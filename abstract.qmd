# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Methods to quantify Gross Primary Production (GPP) are classified into two
categories: Eddy Covariance techniques (EC) and satellite data-driven. EC
techniques can measure carbon fluxes directly, albeit with spatial constraints.
Satellite data-driven methods are promising because they overcome spatial
constraints associated with EC techniques. However, there are challenges
associated with an increase in uncertainty when estimating GPP from
satellite-driven products such as mixed pixels, cloud cover, and the ability of
the sensor to retrieve vegetation under saturation conditions in high biomass
environments. Therefore an effort to analyze and quantify the uncertainty of GPP
products derived from satellite platforms is needed. Here we present how
commonly used satellite vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, CCI, and NIRv) can impact
the uncertainty in the GPP estimation compared with direct methods such as EC
measurements. We conduct this study on three different sites: University of
Michigan Biological Station (USA), the Borden Forest Research Station flux-site
(Canada) and Bartlett Experimental Forest (USA) using traditional regression
methods and ML approaches.
