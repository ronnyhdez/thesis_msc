	abstract = {Global, spatially and temporally explicit estimates of carbon and water ﬂuxes derived from empirical up-scaling eddy covariance measurements would constitute a new and possibly powerful data stream to study the variability of the global terrestrial carbon and water cycle. This paper introduces and validates a machine learning approach dedicated to the upscaling of observations from the current global network of eddy covariance towers (FLUXNET). We present a new model TRee Induction ALgorithm (TRIAL) that performs hierarchical stratiﬁcation of the data set into units where particular multiple regressions for a target variable hold. We propose an ensemble approach (Evolving tRees with RandOm gRowth, ERROR) where the base learning algorithm is perturbed in order to gain a diverse sequence of different model trees which evolves over time.},

	abstract = {Many secondary deciduous forests of eastern North America are approaching a transition in which mature early-successional trees are declining, resulting in an uncertain future for this century-long carbon (C) sink. We initiated the Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment (FASET) at the University of Michigan Biological Station to examine the patterns and mechanisms underlying forest C cycling following the stem girdling-induced mortality of {\textgreater}6,700 early-successional Populus spp. (aspen) and Betula papyrifera (paper birch). Meteorological flux tower-based C cycling observations from the 33-ha treatment forest have been paired with those from a nearby unmanipulated forest since 2008. Following over a decade of observations, we revisit our core hypothesis: that net ecosystem production (NEP) would increase following the transition to mid-late-successional species dominance due to increased canopy structural complexity. Supporting our hypothesis, NEP was stable, briefly declined, and then increased relative to the control in the decade following disturbance; however, increasing NEP was not associated with rising structural complexity but rather with a rapid 1yr recovery of total leaf area index as mid-late-successional Acer, Quercus, and Pinus assumed canopy dominance. The transition to mid-late-successional species dominance improved carbon-use efficiency (CUE = NEP/gross primary production) as ecosystem respiration declined. Similar soil respiration rates in control and treatment forests, along with species differences in leaf physiology and the rising relative growth rates of mid-late-successional species in the treatment forest, suggest changes in aboveground plant respiration and growth were primarily responsible for increases in NEP. We conclude that deciduous forests transitioning from early to middle succession are capable of sustained or increased NEP, even when experiencing extensive tree mortality. This adds to mounting evidence that aging deciduous forests in the region will function as C sinks for decades to come.},

However, despite being the main land evaporative flux at the global scale, transpiration and its response to environmental drivers are currently not well constrained by observations. Here we introduce the first global compilation of whole-plant transpiration data from sap flow measurements (SAPFLUXNET, {\textless}span class="uri"{\textgreater}https://sapfluxnet.creaf.cat/{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, last access: 8 June 2021). We harmonized and quality-controlled individual datasets supplied by contributors worldwide in a semi-automatic data workflow implemented in the R programming language. Datasets include sub-daily time series of sap flow and hydrometeorological drivers for one or more growing seasons, as well as metadata on the stand characteristics, plant attributes, and technical details of the measurements. SAPFLUXNET contains 202 globally distributed datasets with sap flow time series for 2714 plants, mostly trees, of 174 species. SAPFLUXNET has a broad bioclimatic coverage, with woodland/shrubland and temperate forest biomes especially well represented (80 \% of the datasets). The measurements cover a wide variety of stand structural characteristics and plant sizes. The datasets encompass the period between 1995 and 2018, with 50 \% of the datasets being at least 3 years long. Accompanying radiation and vapour pressure deficit data are available for most of the datasets, while on-site soil water content is available for 56 \% of the datasets. Many datasets contain data for species that make up 90 \% or more of the total stand basal area, allowing the estimation of stand transpiration in diverse ecological settings. SAPFLUXNET adds to existing plant trait datasets, ecosystem flux networks, and remote sensing products to help increase our understanding of plant water use, plant responses to drought, and ecohydrological processes. SAPFLUXNET version 0.1.5 is freely available from the Zenodo repository ({\textless}a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3971689"{\textgreater}https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3971689{\textless}/a{\textgreater}; Poyatos et al., 2020a).

	abstract = {The Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica is home to highly diverse forests which are under threat of degradation due to ongoing climatic changes. There is concern that increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation will force these forests outside of their optimal growth ranges leading to widespread degradation of forest productivity. The objectives of this study are, therefore, to project and assess climatic changes in Guanacaste and to build a relationship between these climatic changes and forest productivity with the goal of projecting productivity trends into the future. The ClimateSA model was used to project RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios from 2018 to 2080 and then assess these projections for the mean and extreme future conditions. Furthermore, the MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP) algorithm was used to build a relationship between forest productivity and the vapour pressure deficit scalar (VPD scalar) and project GPP alteration under future climatic scenarios both seasonally and annually. Results indicate that Guanacaste’s mean annual precipitation will stay within the historic levels for both the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The monthly and annual temperatures increase in all projections. Results also indicate that the productivity-climate relationship follows a quadratic relationship between GPP and the VPD scalar. This quadratic relationship leads to areas with higher precipitation (high VPD scalar) experiencing an increase in GPP as they dry in the future. In drier areas (low VPD scalar), reduced precipitation will stabilize or decrease GPP.},

	abstract = {With the eddy-covariance (EC) technique, net ﬂuxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases as well as water and energy ﬂuxes can be measured at the ecosystem level. These ﬂux measurements are a main source for understanding biosphere-atmosphere interactions and feedbacks by cross-site analysis, model-data integration, and up-scaling. The raw ﬂuxes 5 measured with the EC technique require an extensive and laborious data processing. While there are standard tools available in open source environment for processing high-frequency (10 or 20 Hz) data into half-hourly quality checked ﬂuxes, there is a need for more usable and extensible tools for the subsequent post-processing steps. We tackled this need by developing the REddyProc package in the cross-platform language R that provides standard CO2-focused post-processing routines for reading (half-)hourly data from different formats, estimating the uStar threshold, gap-ﬁlling, ﬂux-partitioning, and visualizing the 10 results. In addition to basic processing, the functions are extensible and allow easier integration in extended analysis than current tools. New features include cross year processing and a better treatment of uncertainties. A comparison of REddyProc routines with other state-of the art tools resulted in no signiﬁcant differences in monthly and annual ﬂuxes across sites. Lower uncertainty estimates of both uStar and resulting gap-ﬁlled ﬂuxes with the presented tool was achieved by an improved treatment of seasons during the bootstrap analysis. Higher estimates of uncertainty in day-time partitioning resulted from a better accounting of 15 the uncertainty in estimates of temperature sensitivity of respiration. The provided routines can be easily installed, conﬁgured, used, and integrated with further analysis. Hence the eddy covariance community will beneﬁt from using the provided package, allowing easier integration of standard post-processing with extended analysis.},

	abstract = {The quantiﬁcation of land surface evapotranspiration (ET) at daily or longer time scales is of great signiﬁcance in modeling the global hydrological cycle, studying climate change, and managing water resources. However, current remote sensing-based ET models can generally only provide snapshots of ET at the time of a satellite overpass and do not satisfy the expectations of hydrologists, irrigation engineers, or water resource managers concerned with practical applications. Four commonly used ET upscaling schemes, namely, the constant reference evaporative fraction (EFr) method, the constant evaporative fraction (EF) method, the constant extraterrestrial solar radiation ratio (Rp) method, and the constant observed global solar radiation ratio (Rg) method, were evaluated in this study using ground-based eddy covariance (EC) measurements and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived estimates from a two-source energy balance model. Analysis was made of both closed and un-closed surface ﬂuxes and of different assumed satellite overpass times from midmorning to mid-afternoon. Data for the analysis were collected at the Yucheng comprehensive experimental station in Northern China, spanning the period from late April 2009 to late October 2011. The results show that all four upscaling factors from noon to mid-afternoon had a better agreement with their corresponding daily averages. Overall, the EFr (Rg) method had the best (second best) performance of the four upscaling methods. The EF method was found to signiﬁcantly underestimate the daily latent heat ﬂux (LE) and performed the worst of the four upscaling methods. With the correction of the energy imbalance of EC measurements, the Rg method's performance was improved and outperformed the EFr method in the morning. The presence of clouds either increased or decreased the BIAS but generally increased the root mean square error (RMSE) for all four upscaling methods. When the upscaling methods were applied to convert the instantaneous MODIS remote sensing estimates of ET to daily values, the accuracy of the extrapolated daily ET was controlled by the accuracy of both the remote sensing ET estimates and the upscaling methods themselves. With the insigniﬁcantly biased estimates of the instantaneous LE from the N95 model at 101 MODIS overpass times in this study, using the EF method underestimated the daily ET by 11\%, while all the remaining three factors overestimated the daily ET by a range of 5\%–18\%. This study was conducted to provide a scientiﬁc basis for developing an operational and more accurate ET-upscaling method with easy access to data in future studies.},

	abstract = {Intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) characterizes the physiological control on the simultaneous exchange of water and carbon dioxide in terrestrial ecosystems. Knowledge of iWUE is commonly gained from leaf-level gas exchange measurements, which are inevitably restricted in their spatial and temporal coverage. Flux measurements based on the eddy covariance (EC) technique can overcome these limitations, as they provide continuous and long-term records of carbon and water fluxes at the ecosystem scale. However, vegetation gas exchange parameters derived from EC data are subject to scale-dependent and method-specific uncertainties that compromise their ecophysiological interpretation as well as their comparability among ecosystems and across spatial scales. Here, we use estimates of canopy conductance and gross primary productivity (GPP) derived from EC data to calculate a measure of iWUE (G1, “stomatal slope”) at the ecosystem level at six sites comprising tropical, Mediterranean, temperate, and boreal forests. We assess the following six mechanisms potentially causing discrepancies between leaf and ecosystem-level estimates of G1: (i) non-transpirational water fluxes; (ii) aerodynamic conductance; (iii) meteorological deviations between measurement height and canopy surface; (iv) energy balance non-closure; (v) uncertainties in net ecosystem exchange partitioning; and (vi) physiological withincanopy gradients. Our results demonstrate that an unclosed energy balance caused the largest uncertainties, in particular if it was associated with erroneous latent heat flux estimates. The effect of aerodynamic conductance on G1 was sufficiently captured with a simple representation. G1 was found to be less sensitive to meteorological deviations between canopy surface and measurement height and, given that data are appropriately filtered, to non-transpirational water fluxes. Uncertainties in the derived GPP and physiological within-canopy gradients and their implications for parameter estimates at leaf and ecosystem level are discussed. Our results highlight the importance of adequately considering the sources of uncertainty outlined here when ECderived water-use efficiency is interpreted in an ecophysiological context.},

High-precision measurements are obtained using standardised methodologies, are centrally processed and openly available in a traceable and verifiable fashion in combination with detailed metadata. The Integrated Carbon Observation System ecosystem station network aims to sample climate and land-cover variability across Europe. In addition to GHG flux measurements, a large set of complementary data (including management practices, vegetation and soil characteristics) is collected to support the interpretation, spatial upscaling and modelling of observed ecosystem carbon and GHG dynamics. The applied sampling design was developed and formulated in protocols by the scientific community, representing a trade-off between an ideal dataset and practical feasibility. The use of open-access, high-quality and multi-level data products by different user communities is crucial for the Integrated Carbon Observation System in order to achieve its scientific potential and societal value.},

	abstract = {Tropical vegetation is a major source of global land surface evapotranspiration, and can thus play a major role in global hydrological cycles and global atmospheric circulation. Accurate prediction of tropical evapotranspiration is critical to our understanding of these processes under changing climate. We examined the controls on evapotranspiration in tropical vegetation at 21 pan-tropical eddy covariance sites, conducted a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of 13 evapotranspiration models at these sites, and assessed the ability to scale up model estimates of evapotranspiration for the test region of Amazonia. Net radiation was the strongest determinant of evapotranspiration (mean evaporative fraction was 0.72) and explained 87\% of the variance in monthly evapotranspiration across the sites. Vapor pressure deﬁcit was the strongest residual predictor (14\%), followed by normalized difference vegetation index (9\%), precipitation (6\%) and wind speed (4\%). The radiation-based evapotranspiration models performed best overall for three reasons: (1) the vegetation was largely decoupled from atmospheric turbulent transfer (calculated from X decoupling factor), especially at the wetter sites; (2) the resistance-based models were hindered by difﬁculty in consistently characterizing canopy (and stomatal) resistance in the highly diverse vegetation; (3) the temperature-based models inadequately captured the variability in tropical evapotranspiration. We evaluated the potential to predict regional evapotranspiration for one test region: Amazonia. We estimated an Amazonia-wide evapotranspiration of 1370 mm yrÀ1, but this value is dependent on assumptions about energy balance closure for the tropical eddy covariance sites; a lower value (1096 mm yrÀ1) is considered in discussion on the use of ﬂux data to validate and interpolate models.},

This information gap is exacerbated by insufﬁcient monitoring capabilities from local to global scales. Here, we describe how evapotranspiration (ET) represents the key variable in linking ecosystem functioning, carbon and climate feedbacks, agricultural management, and water resources, and highlight both the outstanding science and applications questions and the actions, especially from a space-based perspective, necessary to advance them.},

	abstract = {We present the R package bigleaf (version 0.6.5), an open source toolset for the derivation of meteorological, aerodynamic, and physiological ecosystem properties from eddy covariance (EC) flux observations and concurrent meteorological measurements. A ‘bigleaf’ framework, in which vegetation is represented as a single, uniform layer, is employed to infer bulk ecosystem characteristics top-down from the measured fluxes. Central to the package is the calculation of a bulk surface/canopy conductance (Gs/Gc) and a bulk aerodynamic conductance (Ga), with the latter including formulations for the turbulent and canopy boundary layer components. The derivation of physical land surface characteristics such as surface roughness parameters, wind profile, aerodynamic and radiometric surface temperature, surface vapor pressure deficit (VPD), potential evapotranspiration (ET), imposed and equilibrium ET, as well as vegetation-atmosphere decoupling coefficients, is described. The package further provides calculation routines for physiological ecosytem properties (stomatal slope parameters, stomatal sensitivity to VPD, bulk intercellular CO2 concentration, canopy photosynthetic capacity), energy balance characteristics (closure, biochemical energy), ancillary meteorological variables (psychrometric constant, saturation vapor pressure, air density, etc.), customary unit interconversions and data filtering. The target variables can be calculated with a different degree of complexity, depending on the amount of available sitespecific information. The utilities of the package are demonstrated for three single-level (above-canopy) eddy covariance sites representing a temperate grassland, a temperate needle-leaf forest, and a Mediterranean evergreen broadleaf forest. The routines are further tested for a two-level EC site (tree and grass layer) located in a Mediterranean oak savanna. The limitations and the ecophysiological interpretation of the derived ecosystem properties are discussed and practical guidelines are given. The package provides the basis for a consistent, physically sound, and reproducible characterization of biometeorological conditions and ecosystem physiology, and is applicable to EC sites across vegetation types and climatic conditions with minimal ancillary data requirements.},

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workﬂow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a ‘DevOps’ philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of heat tolerance of tropical trees have focused on canopy leaves exposed to full sunlight and high temperatures. However, in lowland tropical forests with leaf area indices of 5–6, the vast majority of leaves experience varying degrees of shade and a reduced heat load compared to sun leaves. Here we tested whether heat tolerance is lower in shade than in sun leaves. For three tropical tree species, Calophyllum inophyllum, Inga spectabilis, and Ormosia macrocalyx, disks of fully developed shade and sun leaves were subjected to 15-min heat treatments, followed by measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence after 48 h of recovery. In two of the three species, the temperature causing a 50\% decrease of the fluorescence ratio Fv/Fm (T50) was significantly lower (by {\textasciitilde} 1.0 °C) in shade than in sun leaves, indicating a moderately decreased heat tolerance of shade leaves. In shade leaves of these two species, the rise in initial fluorescence, F0, also occurred at lower temperatures. In the third species, there was no shade-sun difference in T50. In situ measurements of photosynthetic C­ O2 assimilation showed that the optimum temperature for photosynthesis tended to be lower in shade leaves, although differences were not significant. At supra-optimal temperatures, photosynthesis was largely constrained by stomatal conductance, and the high-temperature C­ O2 compensation point, TMax, occurred at considerably lower temperatures than T50. Our study demonstrates that the temperature response of shade leaves of tropical trees differs only marginally from that of sun leaves, both in terms of heat tolerance and photosynthetic performance.},

	abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is dominated by transpiration (T) in the terrestrial water cycle. However, continuous measurement of transpiration is still difﬁcult, and the effect of vegetation on ET partitioning is unclear. The concept of underlying water use efﬁciency (uWUE) was used to develop a new method for ET partitioning by assuming that the maximum, or the potential uWUE is related to T while the averaged or apparent uWUE is related to ET. T/ET was thus estimated as the ratio of the apparent over the potential uWUE using half-hourly ﬂux data from 17 AmeriFlux sites. The estimated potential uWUE was shown to be essentially constant for 14 of the 17 sites, and was broadly consistent with the uWUE evaluated at the leaf scale. The annual T/ET was the highest for croplands, i.e., 0.69 for corn and 0.62 for soybean, followed by grasslands (0.60) and evergreen needle leaf forests (0.56), and was the lowest for deciduous broadleaf forests (0.52). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was shown to be signiﬁcantly correlated with T/ET and could explain about 75\% of the variation in T/ET among the 71 site-years. The coefﬁcients of determination between EVI and T/ET were 0.84 and 0.82 for corn and soybean, respectively, and 0.77 for deciduous broadleaf forests and grasslands, but only 0.37 for evergreen needle leaf forests. This ET partitioning method is sound in principle and simple to apply in practice, and would enhance the value and role of global FLUXNET in estimating T/ET variations and monitoring ecosystem dynamics.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Ball–Berry stomatal conductance model is commonly used in earth system models to simulate biotic regulation of evapotranspiration. However, the dependence of stomatal conductance (gs) on vapor pressure deficit (Ds) and soil moisture must be empirically parameterized. We evaluated the Ball–Berry model used in the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and an alternative stomatal conductance model that links leaf gas exchange, plant hydraulic constraints, and the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPA). The SPA model simulates stomatal conductance numerically by (1) optimizing photosynthetic carbon gain per unit water loss while (2) constraining stomatal opening to prevent leaf water potential from dropping below a critical minimum. We evaluated two optimization algorithms: intrinsic water-use efficiency (ΔAn /Δgs, the marginal carbon gain of stomatal opening) and water-use efficiency (ΔAn /ΔEl, the marginal carbon gain of transpiration water loss). We implemented the stomatal models in a multi-layer plant canopy model to resolve profiles of gas exchange, leaf water potential, and plant hydraulics within the canopy, and evaluated the simulations using leaf analyses, eddy covariance fluxes at six forest sites, and parameter sensitivity analyses. The primary differences among stomatal models relate to soil moisture stress and vapor pressure deficit responses. Without soil moisture stress, the performance of the SPA stomatal model was comparable to or slightly better than the CLM Ball–Berry model in flux tower simulations, but was significantly better than the CLM Ball–Berry model when there was soil moisture stress. Functional dependence of gs on soil moisture emerged from water flow along the soil-to-leaf pathway rather than being imposed a priori, as in the CLM Ball–Berry model. Similar functional dependence of gs on Ds emerged from the ΔAn/ΔEl optimization, but not the ΔAn /gs optimization. Two parameters (stomatal efficiency and root hydraulic conductivity) minimized errors with the SPA stomatal model. The critical stomatal efficiency for optimization (ι) gave results consistent with relationships between maximum An and gs seen in leaf trait data sets and is related to the slope (g1) of the Ball–Berry model. Root hydraulic conductivity (Rr*) was consistent with estimates from literature surveys. The two central concepts embodied in the SPA stomatal model, that plants account for both water-use efficiency and for hydraulic safety in regulating stomatal conductance, imply a notion of optimal plant strategies and provide testable model hypotheses, rather than empirical descriptions of plant behavior.},

	abstract = {Determining water and carbon fluxes over a vegetated surface is important in a context of global environmental changes and the fluxes help in understanding ecosystem functioning. Pursuant to this, the study measured evapotranspiration (ET) using an eddy covariance (EC) system installed over an intact example of the Albany Thicket (AT) vegetation in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Environmental constraints to ET were also assessed by examining the response of ET to biotic and abiotic factors. The EC system comprised of an open path Infrared Gas Analyser and Sonic anemometer and an attendant weather station to measure bi-meteorological variables. Post processing of eddy covariance data was conducted using EddyPro software. Quality assessment of fluxes was also performed and rejected and missing data were filled using the method of mean diurnal variations (MDV). Much of the variation in ET was accounted for by the leaf area index (LAI, p {\textless} 0.001, 41\%) and soil moisture content (SWC, p {\textless} 0.001, 32\%). Total measured ET during the experiment was greater than total rainfall received owing to the high water storage capacity of the vegetation and the possibility of vegetation accessing ground water. Most of the net radiation was consumed by sensible heat flux and this means that ET in the area is essentially water limited since abundant energy was available to drive turbulent transfers of energy. Understanding the environmental constraints to ET is crucial in predicting the ecosystem response to environmental forces such as climate change.},

The processes responsible for the decrease in photosynthesis at higher temperatures are not fully understood for tropical trees. We determined temperature responses of maximum rates of RuBP‐carboxylation (VCMax) and RuBP‐regeneration (JMax), stomatal conductance (Gs), and respiration in the light (RLight) in situ for 4 lowland tropical tree species in Panama. Gs had the lowest temperature optimum (TOpt), similar to that of net photosynthesis, and photosynthesis became increasingly limited by stomatal conductance as temperature increased. JMax peaked at 34–37 °C and VCMax {\textasciitilde}2 °C above that, except in the late‐successional species Calophyllum longifolium, in which both peaked at {\textasciitilde}33 °C. RLight significantly increased with increasing temperature, but simulations with a photosynthesis model indicated that this had only a small effect on net photosynthesis. We found no evidence for Rubisco‐activase limitation of photosynthesis. TOpt of VCMax and JMax fell within the observed in situ leaf temperature range, but our study nonetheless suggests that net photosynthesis of tropical trees is more strongly influenced by the indirect effects of high temperature—for example, through elevated vapour pressure deficit and resulting decreases in stomatal conductance—than by direct temperature effects on photosynthetic biochemistry and respiration.},

With its representative sampling of the terrestrial biosphere's climate and ecological spaces, this network is providing background information and direct measurements on how ecosystem metabolism responds to environmental and biological forcings and how they may be changing in a warmer world with more carbon dioxide. In this review, I explore how carbon and water fluxes of the world's ecosystem are responding to a suite of covarying environmental factors, like sunlight, temperature, soil moisture, and carbon dioxide. I also report on how coupled carbon and water fluxes are modulated by biological and ecological factors such as phenology and a suite of structural and functional properties. And, I investigate whether long‐term trends in carbon and water fluxes are emerging in various ecological and climate spaces and the degree to which they may be driven by physical and biological forcings. As a growing number of time series extend up to 20 years in duration, we are at the verge of capturing ecosystem scale trends in the breathing of a changing biosphere. Consequently, flux measurements need to continue to report on future conditions and responses and assess the efficacy of natural climate solutions.},

	abstract = {The measurement of carbon exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere is vital to quantify the impact of environmental variables on the carbon sequestration capacity of forests, and to predict how they will respond to future climate. In this study we use proximal remote sensing, deﬁned as observations made from non-contact radiometric or imaging sensors in close proximity to the forest canopy (10–20 m), as an intermediate upscaling tool between direct measurements of carbon ﬂuxes and satellite-derived estimations of primary productivity in a tropical dry forest (TDF) in Jalisco, Mexico. Two broad-band vegetation indices (VIs), the normalized difference VI and the enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), were calculated from proximally sensed canopy properties, validated with ﬁeld estimates of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation by photosynthetic tissue (fAPARgreen), and compared to estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange of CO2, measured from a ﬂux tower. The VIs captured the phenology of the TDF, both under typical summer rainfall and during an atypically-dry wet season in El Niñ o of 2009. The VIs also tracked a secondary leaf-ﬂushing in the dry season of 2010. Our study suggests that (1) VIs are the best predictors of gross carbon uptake, able to explain up to 86\% of variations in GPP; (2) VIs are accurate predictors of the photosynthetic capacity of green tissue, able to explain up to 99\% of fAPARgreen variation; and (3) VIs and soil water content can be used to develop an empirical model that captures the seasonal trajectory of GPP from high respiration after the rain pulses, to rapid leaf development, and ﬁnally to slow senescence as the soil dries out. Proximal remote sensing constitutes a useful tool to link ﬁeld-base measurements of carbon ﬂuxes to satellite- or airborne-derived estimates of carbon exchange.},

During land plant evolution, a variety of different tree constructions evolved and their constructional principles are a subject of ongoing research. Understanding the “natural construction” of trees benefits strongly from methods and approaches from physics and engineering. Plant water transport is a good example for the ongoing demand for interdisciplinary efforts to unravel form-function relationships on vastly differing scales. Identification of the unique mechanism of water long-distance transport requires a solid basis of interfacial physics and thermodynamics.

	abstract = {We compared estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ET) produced with six different vegetation measures derived from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and three contrasting estimation approaches using measurements from eddy covariance ﬂux towers at 16 FLUXNET sites located over six different land cover types. The aim was to assess optimal approaches in using optical remote sensing to estimate ET. The ﬁrst two approaches directly regressed various MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) and products such as leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) with ET and evaporative fraction (EF). In the third approach, the Penman–Monteith (PM) equation was inverted to obtain surface conductance (Gs), for dry plant canopies. The Gs values were then regressed against the MODIS data products and used to parameterize the PM equation for retrievals of ET. Jack-Knife cross-validation was used to evaluate the various regression models against observed ET. The PM-Gs approach provided the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), and highest determination coefﬁcients (R2) across all sites, with an average RMSE = 38 W m−2 and R2 = 0.72. Direct regressions of observed ET against the VIs resulted in an average RMSE = 60 W m−2 and R2 = 0.22, while the EF regressions an average RMSE = 42 W m−2 and R2 = 0.64. The MODIS LAI and fPAR product produced the poorest estimates of ET (RMSE {\textgreater} 44 W m−2 and R2 b 0.6); while the VIs each performed best for some of the land cover types. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) produced the best ET estimates for evergreen needleleaf forest (RMSE = 28.4 W m−2, R2 = 0.66). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) best estimated ET in grassland (RMSE = 23.8 W m−2 and R2 = 0.68), cropland (RMSE = 29.2 W m−2 and R2 = 0.86) and woody savannas (RMSE = 25.4 W m−2 and R2 = 0.82), while the VI-based crop coefﬁcient (Kc) yielded the best estimates for evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forests (RMSE = 27 W m−2 and R2 = 0.7 in both cases). Using the ensemble-average of ET as estimated using NDVI, EVI and Kc we computed global grids of dry canopy conductance (Gc) from which annual statistics were extracted to characterise different functional types. The resulting Gc values can be used to parameterize land surface models.},

	abstract = {Testing Technical Debt (TTD) occurs due to shortcuts (non-optimal decisions) taken about testing; it is the test dimension of technical debt. R is a package-based programming ecosystem that provides an easy way to install third-party code, datasets, tests, documentation and examples. This structure makes it especially vulnerable to TTD because errors present in a package can transitively affect all packages and scripts that depend on it. Thus, TTD can effectively become a threat to the validity of all analysis written in R that rely on potentially faulty code. This two-part study provides the ﬁrst analysis in this area. First, 177 systematically-selected, open-source R packages were mined and analysed to address quality of testing, testing goals, and identify potential TTD sources. Second, a survey addressed how R package developers perceive testing and face its challenges (response rate of 19.4\%). Results show that testing in R packages is of low quality; the most common smells are inadequate and obscure unit testing, improper asserts, inexperienced testers and improper test design. Furthermore, skilled R developers still face challenges such as time constraints, emphasis on development rather than testing, poor tool documentation and a steep learning curve.},

In this paper, we explore the effect of drought on phenology and carbon dynamics of a secondary TDF located in the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP), Costa Rica. Through the use of optical sensors and an eddy covariance ﬂux tower, seasonal phenology and carbon ﬂuxes were monitored over a four-year period (2013–2016). Over this time frame, annual precipitation varied considerably. Total precipitation amounts for the 2013–2016 seasons equaled 1591.8 mm (+14.4 mm SD), 1112.9 mm (+9.9 mm SD), 600.8 mm (+7.6 mm SD), and 1762.2 mm (+13.9 mm SD), respectively. The 2014 and 2015 (ENSO) seasonal precipitation amounts represent a 30\% and 63\% reduction in precipitation, respectively, and were designated as drought seasons. Phenology was affected by precipitation patterns and availability. The onset of green-up was closely associated with pre-seasonal rains. Drought events lead to seasonal NDVI minimums and changes in phenologic cycle length. Carbon ﬂuxes, assimilation, and photosynthetic light use efﬁciency were negatively affected by drought. Seasonal minimums in photosynthetic rates and light use efﬁciency were observed during drought events, and gross primary productivity was reduced by 13\% and 42\% during drought seasons 2014 and 2015, respectively. However, all four growth seasons were net carbon sinks. Results from this study contribute towards a deeper understanding of the impact of drought on TDF phenology and carbon dynamics.},

	abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of terrestrial ecosystems because it links the hydrological, energy, and carbon cycles. Several satellite-based ET models have been developed for extrapolating local observations to regional and global scales, but recent studies have shown large model uncertainties in ET simulations. In this study, we compared eight ET models, including ﬁve empirical and three process-based models, with the objective of providing a reference for choosing and improving methods. The results showed that the eight models explained between 61 and 80\% of the variability in ET at 23 eddy covariance towers in China and adjacent regions. The mean annual ET for all of China varied from 535 to 852 mm yr−1 among the models. The interannual variability of yearly ET varied signiﬁcantly between models during 1982–2009 because of different model structures and the dominant environmental factors employed. Our evaluation results showed that the parameters of the empirical methods may have different combination because the environmental factors of ET are not independent. Although the three process-based models showed high model performance across the validation sites, there were substantial differences among them in the temporal and spatial patterns of ET, the dominant environment factors and the energy partitioning schemes. The disagreement among current ET models highlights the need for further improvements and validation, which can be achieved by investigating model structures and examining the ET component estimates and the critical model parameters.},

	abstract = {Even though existing remote-sensing-based drought indices are widely used in many different types of ecosystems, their utility has not been widely assessed in tropical dry forests (TDFs). The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of three remote-sensing-based drought indices, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI), for meteorological drought monitoring in TDFs using the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The correlation between the VCI, TCI, and VHI and multiple time scales of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 months) for each month (January to December) and each season (dry season, dry-to-wet season, wet season and wet-to-dry season) were conducted using the Pearson correlation analysis. We also correlated year-to-year changes of satellite-based drought indices with the changes of the in situ annual SPI (A\_SPI) which provides annual information on the mean meteorological drought. The analysis reveals that the ability of these remote-sensing-based drought indices for meteorological drought monitoring varies with timing, and the TCI outperforms the VCI and VHI in terms of seasonal and annual scale. These remote-sensing indices performed well in monitoring meteorological drought in the dry season, poorly in the in the dry-to-wet season, and moderately in the wet season. The TCI performed best in monitoring meteorological drought in the wet-to-dry period, followed by VHI, whereas the VCI performed worst. All of these remote-sensing-based drought indices failed to detect drought in May during the green-up period and in September, October, and November when the water content in the root regions was abundant. Our results indicate that the evapotranspiration of TDFs is more sensitive than canopy greenness to detect meteorological drought. Results from this study increase the ability to provide real-time drought monitoring and early warnings of drought in TDFs.},

	abstract = {Tropical deciduous forests are unique in terms of their geographical distribution, strong seasonality and their contribution to global carbon dynamics, but yet their carbon sequestration potential is poorly sampled. In the current study, we report the carbon balance of 65-year-old tropical dry deciduous forest in central India using the multi-year eddy covariance measurements from November 2011 to May 2019. Over the study period, the forest site was observed to be a net sink of atmospheric CO2 with a mean annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of 524 (± 40; ±1 SD across different years) g C m−2 yr−1 with a 233 (±15) day growing season. The NEP was partitioned into gross primary productivity (GPP) of 3358 (± 167) g C m−2 yr−1 and annual carbon loss due to respiration and decomposition (Reco) of 2834 (± 157) g C m−2 yr−1. The ecosystem showed a strong seasonality as a source of carbon during the leaf-off season (March to June), and as a carbon sink during the rest of the year with significant sequestration during the winter season (October to December). The intra-annual analysis suggested that CO2 flux is primarily controlled by canopy greenness with mean Reco/GPP ratio varying from 1.90 (± 0.12) to 0.79 (± 0.04) during leaf-off to leaf-on seasons. The monthly C fluxes in the growing season are found to be strongly correlated to the environmental variables rather than in the leaf-off season, while variability in monthly ecosystem respiration was better explained by air temperature during the leaf-off season than the growing season. Further, the inter-annual variability of NEP was mainly dependent on growing season length and mean annual temperature. The variations in annual GPP and Reco were directly dependent on the increase in mean annual temperature. The eddy covariance-based NEP was complemented by close independent biometric estimates, imparting confidence in our measurements. In conclusion, this tropical dry deciduous forest site is a substantial carbon sink and would add crucial information regarding carbon budgeting of tropical forests in global carbon balance models.},

Scaling the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and NIRV from FLUXNET eddy covariance sites, we estimate global annual terrestrial photosynthesis to be 147 Pg C/year (95\% credible interval 131–163 Pg C/year), which falls between bottom‐up GPP estimates and the top‐down global constraint on GPP from oxygen isotopes. NIRV‐derived estimates of GPP are systematically higher than existing bottom‐up estimates, especially throughout the midlatitudes. Progress in improving estimated GPP from NIRV can come from improved cloud screening in satellite data and increased resolution of vegetation characteristics, especially details about plant photosynthetic pathway.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of far-red sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as an important tool for studying gross primary productivity (GPP) at the global scale. However, the relationship between SIF and GPP at the canopy scale lacks a clear mechanistic explanation. This is largely due to the poorly characterized role of the relative contributions from canopy structure and leaf physiology to the variability of the top-of-canopy, observed SIF signal. In particular, the effect of the canopy structure beyond light absorption is that only a fraction (fesc) of the SIF emitted from all leaves in the canopy can escape from the canopy due to the strong scattering of nearinfrared radiation. We combined rice, wheat and corn canopy-level in-situ datasets to study how the physiological and structural components of SIF individually relate to measures of photosynthesis. At seasonal time scales, we found a considerably strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.4–0.6) of fesc to the seasonal dynamics of the photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUEP), while the estimated physiological SIF yield was almost entirely uncorrelated to LUEP both at seasonal and diurnal time scales, with the partial exception of wheat. Consistent with these findings, the canopy structure and radiation component of SIF, defined as the product of APAR and fesc, explained the relationship of observed SIF to GPP and even outperformed GPP estimation based on observed SIF at two of the three sites investigated. These results held for both half-hourly and daily mean values. In contrast, the total emitted SIF, obtained by normalizing observed SIF for fesc, improved only the relationship to APAR but considerably decreased the correlation to GPP for all three crops. Our findings demonstrate the dominant role of canopy structure in the SIF-GPP relationship and establish a strong, mechanistic link between the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and the relevant canopy structure information contained in the SIF signal. These insights are expected to be useful in improving remote sensing based GPP estimates.},

	abstract = {The role of tropical forests in sustainable development mechanisms and payments for environmental services is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, there is a greater need for accurate and detailed information about their biophysical characteristics (e.g., Leaf area index – LAI) along different stages of ecological succession. Remote sensing offers the possibility of providing relatively accurate estimations of such biophysical characteristics at a reasonable cost for most regional projects. The objectives of this study are to (1) document the variability of LAI in different stages of secondary growth in a tropical moist forest, (2) estimate LAI from spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), and (3) link LAI to the estimation of other canopy physiognomic characteristics. We found that segregation of LAI measurements by successional stage (early, intermediate, late) contributed to a better definition of the relationship between LAI and the SVIs. In addition, we conclude that the propagation of errors of precision through the SVI formulas must be taken into consideration along with intra-site and radiometric variability when uncertainty terms are calculated. From a linear regression analysis, we found that there is only a minimal difference between the nonparametric Theil – Sen and classical least-squares regressions. We also found that not only does the Lorentzian cumulative transition function describe the relationship between LAI and the SVIs, it also provides an estimate of the range of LAI values to which each index is sensitive.},

	abstract = {Carbon sequestration by forests is one of the vital ecosystem services regulating the global climate. Equally important are the socio-economic co-beneﬁts of carbon sequestration, given their implications for designing policies focused on conservation or restoration of tropical forests. Much debate has been around how to account for, and maximize, the co-beneﬁts of carbon sequestration. Prior research suggests that a better understanding of the spatial relationship between carbon sequestration potential and forest types and dynamics - as a function of geographical context and time - is needed to better estimate their socio-economic beneﬁts. Hence, this paper uses the Tropical Dry Forests of Central and South America to propose a new approach to quantify carbon sequestration of this biome, and its efﬁciency, using time series of the Terra-MODIS satellite. Our estimations of carbon sequestration are then coupled with a beneﬁt transfer approach to infer carbon sequestration’s monetary cost. Results reveal that these tropical forests sequester an annual average of 22.3 Æ 3.3 tCO2 ha-1 yr-1 or in total, 1.16 GtCO2. The associated social cost of carbon, calculated using three econometric models, ranges from USD 489 ha1 yr-1 to USD 2828 ha-1 yr-1. These results can open new perspectives regarding the beneﬁts of carbon sequestration against the costs of the negative impacts of climate change for national welfare accounts, their relevance for environmental policy-making, and the implementation or monitoring of carbon-based incentive programs (e.g., WAVES).},

	abstract = {Virtually all remotely sensed data contain spatial autocorrelation, which impacts upon their statistical features of uncertainty through variance inﬂation, and the compounding of duplicate information. Estimating the nature and degree of this spatial autocorrelation, which is usually positive and very strong, has been hindered by computational intensity associated with the massive number of pixels in realistically-sized remotely-sensed images, a situation that more recently has changed. Recent advances in spatial statistical estimation theory support the extraction of information and the distilling of knowledge from remotely-sensed images in a way that accounts for latent spatial autocorrelation. This paper summarizes an effective methodological approach to achieve this end, illustrating results with a 2002 remotely sensed-image of the Florida Everglades, and simulation experiments. Speciﬁcally, uncertainty of spatial autocorrelation parameter in a spatial autoregressive model is modeled with a beta-beta mixture approach and is further investigated with three different sampling strategies: coterminous sampling, random sub-region sampling, and increasing domain sub-regions. The results suggest that uncertainty associated with remotely-sensed data should be cast in consideration of spatial autocorrelation. It emphasizes that one remaining challenge is to better quantify the spatial variability of spatial autocorrelation estimates across geographic landscapes.},

	abstract = {With a wide range of satellite-derived vegetation bio-geophysical products now available to users, validation efforts are required to assess their accuracy and ﬁtness for purpose. Substantial progress in the validation of such products has been made over the last two decades, but quantiﬁcation of the uncertainties associated with in situ reference measurements is rarely performed, and the incorporation of uncertainties within upscaling procedures is cursory at best. Since current validation practices assume that reference data represent the truth, our ability to reliably demonstrate compliance with product uncertainty requirements through conformity testing is limited. The Fiducial Reference Measurements for Vegetation (FRM4VEG) project, initiated by the European Space Agency, is aiming to address this challenge by applying metrological principles to vegetation and surface reﬂectance product validation. Following FRM principles, and in accordance with the International Standards Organisation’s (ISO) Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), for the ﬁrst time, we describe an end-to-end uncertainty evaluation framework for reference data of two key vegetation bio-geophysical variables: the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). The process involves quantifying the uncertainties associated with individual in situ reference measurements and incorporating these uncertainties within the upscaling procedure (as well as those associated with the high-spatialresolution imagery used for upscaling). The framework was demonstrated in two ﬁeld campaigns covering agricultural crops (Las Tiesas–Barrax, Spain) and deciduous broadleaf forest (Wytham Woods, UK). Providing high-spatial-resolution reference maps with per-pixel uncertainty estimates, the framework is applicable to a range of other bio-geophysical variables including leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of vegetation cover (FCOVER), and canopy water content (CWC). The proposed procedures will facilitate conformity testing of moderate spatial resolution vegetation bio-geophysical products in future validation exercises.},

While a number of strategies for empirical models with eddy-covariance flux data have been applied, a systematic intercomparison of these methods has been missing so far. In this study, we performed a cross-validation experiment for predicting carbon dioxide, latent heat, sensible heat and net radiation fluxes across different ecosystem types with 11 machine learning (ML) methods from four different classes (kernel methods, neural networks, tree methods, and regression splines). We applied two complementary setups: (1) 8-day average fluxes based on remotely sensed data and (2) daily mean fluxes based on meteorological data and a mean seasonal cycle of remotely sensed variables. The patterns of predictions from different ML and experimental setups were highly consistent. There were systematic differences in performance among the fluxes, with the following ascending order: net ecosystem exchange (R2 {\textless} 0.5), ecosystem respiration (R2 {\textgreater} 0.6), gross primary production (R2{\textgreater} 0.7), latent heat (R2 {\textgreater} 0.7), sensible heat (R2 {\textgreater} 0.7), and net radiation (R2 {\textgreater} 0.8). The ML methods predicted the across-site variability and the mean seasonal cycle of the observed fluxes very well (R2 {\textgreater} 0.7), while the 8-day deviations from the mean seasonal cycle were not well predicted (R2 {\textless} 0.5). Fluxes were better predicted at forested and temperate climate sites than at sites in extreme climates or less represented by training data (e.g., the tropics). The evaluated large ensemble of ML-based models will be the basis of new global flux products.},

	abstract = {Although satellite-based light use efficiency (LUE) model is widely used to estimate gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems, microwave observations have not been integrated into LUE models. This study developed a new LUE model coupled with a passive microwave vegetation index (Emissivity Difference Vege­ tation Index, EDVI) for daily GPP estimation. Normalized EDVI (nEDVI), an indicator of canopy-scale leaf development and biomass change, was used as a proxy of fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR). EDVI-based evaporative fraction (EDVI-EF) under all sky was used to indicate synoptic-scale water stress on LUE. 8-year in-situ measurements from seven flux tower sites (four forests, two grasslands and one croplands) of ChinaFLUX network were used to evaluate the model. We found that nEDVI-based FPAR better captured the short-term variations in daily in-situ GPP (GPPobs) than other optic-based FPAR schemes. This capability of nEDVI was more noticeable under moderate and heavy cloud cover (Frc) conditions. Validations against daily GPPobs at all sites showed that EDVI-based GPP (GPPEDVI) generated an overall small bias of − 0.47 gC m− 2 day− 1 (− 8.1\%) and good Taylor score (S) of 0.86 at the daily scale. Better accuracy of GPPEDVI was found at forests sites with R2 of 0.43 to 0.73, bias of-5.29\% to 3.03\% and S of 0.58 to 0.78, respectively. At a tropical forest site with most frequent cloud cover, the model also well captured the variation in GPPobs from clear sky to cloudy sky (R2 of 0.93) with stable accuracies. Furthermore, the accuracy of daily GPPEDVI was found to be comparable with global satellite optic MOD17 GPP (GPPMOD17) and EC-LUE GPP (GPPECLUE) from 8-day to yearly scales across the sites. In particular, GPPEDVI performed generally smaller bias at evergreen broadleaf forests, while both of GPPMOD17 and GPPECLUE were overestimated, suggesting that there could be less saturation for microwave-based LUE model over dense vegetation. Although all three satellite LUE models severely underestimated GPP of crop, GPPEDVI generated lower bias (− 29.8\%) than GPPMOD17 (− 66.8\%) and GPPECLUE (− 59.5\%). Overall, this study is the first attempt toward the integration of microwave-derived variables into LUE model for daily GPP estimation. The microwave-based LUE model has a potential of mapping spatiotemporally continues daily GPP under various clouds.},

	abstract = {Climate change (CLI), elevated CO2 concentration (CO2), and land use change (LUC) have strongly altered land evapotranspiration (ET) during the recent decades. The fingerprints of these drivers in ET change, however, have not previously been detected due to the lack of these three scenarios from global climate models (GCMs). Here we applied an optimal fingerprint method to detect and attribute ET change by integrated utilization of state-ofthe-art global ecosystem models and GCMs. Results indicate that CLI provides the greatest contribution to increasing ET, and its fingerprint is detectable at different timescales. CO2 reduces ET in most areas covered by forests. LUC decreases ET over the tropics, while increases ET over temperate and high-latitude regions. To further subdivide the impacts of CLI, we extend the Budyko framework to quantify the contribution of precip­ itation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) and find that the dominant role of CLI mainly depends on the contribution of P.},

	abstract = {The exploitation of Earth observation satellite images acquired by optical instruments requires an automatic and accurate cloud detection. Multitemporal approaches to cloud detection are usually more powerful than their single scene counterparts since the presence of clouds varies greatly from one acquisition to another whereas surface can be assumed stationary in a broad sense. However, two practical limitations usually hamper their operational use: the access to the complete satellite image archive and the required computational power. This work presents a cloud detection and removal methodology implemented in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform in order to meet these requirements. The proposed methodology is tested for the Landsat-8 mission over a large collection of manually labeled cloud masks from the Biome dataset. The quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance compared with mono-temporal standard approaches, such as FMask and ACCA algorithms, yielding improvements between 4–5\% in classiﬁcation accuracy and 3–10\% in commission errors. The algorithm implementation within the Google Earth Engine and the generated cloud masks for all test images are released for interested readers.},

	abstract = {Due to its relation to the Earth’s climate and weather and phenomena like drought, ﬂooding, or landslides, knowledge of the soil moisture content is valuable to many scientiﬁc and professional users. Remote-sensing offers the unique possibility for continuous measurements of this variable. Especially for agriculture, there is a strong demand for high spatial resolution mapping. However, operationally available soil moisture products exist with medium to coarse spatial resolution only (≥1 km). This study introduces a machine learning (ML)—based approach for the high spatial resolution (50 m) mapping of soil moisture based on the integration of Landsat-8 optical and thermal images, Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR images, and modelled data, executable in the Google Earth Engine. The novelty of this approach lies in applying an entirely data-driven ML concept for global estimation of the surface soil moisture content. Globally distributed in situ data from the International Soil Moisture Network acted as an input for model training. Based on the independent validation dataset, the resulting overall estimation accuracy, in terms of Root-Mean-Squared-Error and R2, was 0.04 m3·m−3 and 0.81, respectively. Beyond the retrieval model itself, this article introduces a framework for collecting training data and a stand-alone Python package for soil moisture mapping. The Google Earth Engine Python API facilitates the execution of data collection and retrieval which is entirely cloud-based. For soil moisture retrieval, it eliminates the requirement to download or preprocess any input datasets.},

The retrieval chain is based on a hybrid method inverting the PROSAIL radiative transfer model (RTM) with Random forests (RF) regression. A major feature of this work is the implementation of a retrieval chain exploiting the GEE capabilities using global and climate data records (CDR) of both MODIS surface reﬂectance and LAI/FAPAR datasets allowing the global estimation of biophysical variables at unprecedented timeliness. We combine a massive global compilation of leaf trait measurements (TRY), which is the baseline for more realistic leaf parametrization for the considered RTM, with large amounts of remote sensing data ingested by GEE. Moreover, the proposed retrieval chain includes the estimation of both FVC and CWC, which are not operationally produced for the MODIS sensor. The derived global estimates are validated over the BELMANIP2.1 sites network by means of an inter-comparison with the MODIS LAI/FAPAR product available in GEE. Overall, the retrieval chain exhibits great consistency with the reference MODIS product (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.54 m2/m2 and ME = 0.03 m2/m2 in the case of LAI, and R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.09 and ME = 0.05 in the case of FAPAR). The analysis of the results by land cover type shows the lowest correlations between our retrievals and the MODIS reference estimates (R2 = 0.42 and R2 = 0.41 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) for evergreen broadleaf forests. These discrepancies could be attributed mainly to different product deﬁnitions according to the literature. The provided results proof that GEE is a suitable high performance processing tool for global biophysical variable retrieval for a wide range of applications.},

The free-to-use GEE platform provides access to (1) petabytes of publicly available remote sensing imagery and other ready-to-use products with an explorer web app; (2) high-speed parallel processing and machine learning algorithms using Google’s computational infrastructure; and (3) a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with development environments that support popular coding languages, such as JavaScript and Python. Together these core features enable users to discover, analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of GEE that can provide readers with the “big picture” of the current status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data, sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in 146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed. Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90\% of studies while 10\% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses. Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40 years, has been used extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used in 27\% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving process of geo-big data.},

	abstract = {Eddy covariance data from regional ﬂux networks are direct in situ measurement of carbon, water, and energy ﬂuxes and are of vital importance for understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of the the global carbon cycle. FLUXNET links regional networks of eddy covariance sites across the globe to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of ﬂuxes at regional to global scales and to detect emergent ecosystem properties. This study presents an assessment of the representativeness of 5 FLUXNET based on the recently released FLUXNET2015 data set. We present a detailed high resolution analysis of the evolving representativeness of FLUXNET through time. Results provide quantitative insights into the extent that various biomes are sampled by the network of networks, the role of the spatial distribution of the sites on the network scale representativeness at any given time, and how that representativeness has changed through time due to changing operational status and data availability at sites in the network. To realize the full potential of FLUXNET observations for understanding emergent ecosystem 10 properties at regional and global scales, we present an approach for upscaling eddy covariance measurements. Informed by the representativeness of observations at the ﬂux sites in the network, the upscaled data reﬂects the spatio-temporal dynamics of the carbon cycle captured by the in situ measurements. This study presents a method for optimal use of the rich point measurements from FLUXNET to derive an understanding of upscaled carbon ﬂuxes, which can be routinely updated as new data become available, and direct network expansion by identifying regions poorly sampled by the current network.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral airborne imagery can provide rich information on plant physiological and structural properties at a scale intermediate to that of proximal and satellite remote sensing and has broad applications in assessing ecosystem function and biodiversity. A key processing step of airborne hyperspectral data is the atmospheric correction that compensates for path radiance, aerosol effects and gas absorption to derive an accurate surface reflectance that can be compared across time and space. In practice, routine correction procedures are often customized for various platforms without fully reporting or checking the errors systematically in the atmospheric correction. Such errors can have significant effects on downstream analyses such as vegetation indices or trait retrievals, and not all subsequent analyses are equally affected by the accuracy of reflectance retrievals. In this study, we examined the errors in three types of atmospheric correction methods including a radiative transfer model (RTM), empirical line correction (ELC) and a hybrid method that combines elements of the two via Bayesian inference. Our results revealed that the individual correction methods had different effects on the reflectance retrievals that impacted downstream measurements. Including spectral measurements from ground vegetation targets in addition to painted calibration targets improved the performance of the ELC method. The hybrid method yielded reflectance spectra that most closely matched the spectra of the ground validation data. The errors in vegetation indices differed with the methods, and certain indices (such as PRI) were more affected than indices that rely on stable, broader spectral features (e.g., NDVI). Plant pigment retrievals via partial least squares regression were less sensitive to errors in atmospheric correction. These findings demonstrate that obtaining high-quality, field spectral measurements over well-characterized calibration targets and representa­ tive land cover types within the scene is critical for accurate surface reflectance and subsequent downstream products, such as vegetation indices or plant traits.},

	abstract = {Large datasets of greenhouse gas and energy surface-atmosphere fluxes measured with the eddy-covariance technique (e.g., FLUXNET2015, AmeriFlux BASE) are widely used to benchmark models and remote-sensing products. This study addresses one of the major challenges facing model-data integration: To what spatial extent do flux measurements taken at individual eddy-covariance sites reflect model- or satellite-based grid cells? We evaluate flux footprints—the temporally dynamic source areas that contribute to measured fluxes—and the representativeness of these footprints for target areas (e.g., within 250–3000 m radii around flux towers) that are often used in flux-data synthesis and modeling studies. We examine the land-cover composition and vegetation characteristics, represented here by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), in the flux footprints and target areas across 214 AmeriFlux sites, and evaluate potential biases as a consequence of the footprint-to-target-area mismatch. Monthly 80\% footprint climatologies vary across sites and through time ranging four orders of magnitude from 103 to 107 m2 due to the measurement heights, underlying vegetation- and ground-surface characteristics, wind directions, and turbulent state of the atmosphere. Few eddy-covariance sites are located in a truly homogeneous landscape. Thus, the common model-data integration approaches that use a fixed-extent target area across sites introduce biases on the order of 4\%–20\% for EVI and 6\%–20\% for the dominant land cover percentage. These biases are site-specific functions of measurement heights, target area extents, and landsurface characteristics. We advocate that flux datasets need to be used with footprint awareness, especially in research and applications that benchmark against models and data products with explicit spatial information. We propose a simple representativeness index based on our evaluations that can be used as a guide to identify siteperiods suitable for specific applications and to provide general guidance for data use.},

Terrestrial productivity, however, has many facets (e.g., spatial and temporal variability, including seasonality, interannual variability, and trends), and different vegetation indices may not be equally good at predicting them. Their accuracy in monitoring productivity has been mostly tested in single-ecosystem studies, but their performance in different ecosystems distributed over large areas still needs to be fully explored. To fill this gap, we identified the facets of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) that could be monitored using RSVIs. We compared the temporal and spatial patterns of four vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NIRV, and CCI), derived from the MODIS MAIAC data set and of GPP derived from data from 58 eddy-flux towers in eight ecosystems with different plant functional types (evergreen needle-leaved forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, open shrubland, grassland, cropland, and wetland) distributed throughout Europe, covering Mediterranean, temperate, and boreal regions. The RSVIs monitored temporal variability well in most of the ecosystem types, with grasslands and evergreen broad-leaved forests most strongly and weakly correlated with weekly and monthly RSVI data, respectively. The performance of the RSVIs monitoring temporal variability decreased sharply, however, when the seasonal component of the time series was removed, suggesting that the seasonal cycles of both the GPP and RSVI time series were the dominant drivers of their relationships. Removing winter values from the analyses did not affect the results. NDVI and CCI identified the spatial variability of average annual GPP, and all RSVIs identified GPP seasonality well. The RSVI estimates, however, could not estimate the interannual variability of GPP across sites or monitor the trends of GPP. Overall, our results indicate that RSVIs are suitable to track different facets of GPP variability at the local scale, therefore they are reliable sources of GPP monitoring at larger geographical scales.},

	abstract = {Eddy covariance measurement systems provide direct observation of the exchange of greenhouse gases between ecosystems and the atmosphere, but have only occasionally been intentionally applied to quantify the carbon dynamics associated with speciﬁc climate mitigation strategies. Natural climate solutions (NCS) harness the photosynthetic power of ecosystems to avoid emissions and remove atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), sequestering it in biological carbon pools. In this perspective, we aim to determine which kinds of NCS strategies are most suitable for ecosystem-scale ﬂux measurements and how these measurements should be deployed for diverse NCS scales and goals. We ﬁnd that ecosystem-scale ﬂux measurements bring unique value when assessing NCS strategies characterized by inaccessible and hard-to-observe carbon pool changes, important non-CO2 greenhouse gas ﬂuxes, the potential for biophysical impacts, or dynamic successional changes. We propose three deployment types for ecosystem-scale ﬂux measurements at various NCS scales to constrain wide uncertainties and chart a workable path forward: “pilot”, “upscale”, and “monitor”. Together, the integration of ecosystem-scale ﬂux measurements by the NCS community and the prioritization of NCS measurements by the ﬂux community, have the potential to improve accounting in ways that capture the net impacts, unintended feedbacks, and on-the-ground speciﬁcs of a wide range of emerging NCS strategies.},

	abstract = {With a wide range of satellite-derived vegetation bio-geophysical products now available to users, validation efforts are required to assess their accuracy and ﬁtness for purpose. Substantial progress in the validation of such products has been made over the last two decades, but quantiﬁcation of the uncertainties associated with in situ reference measurements is rarely performed, and the incorporation of uncertainties within upscaling procedures is cursory at best. Since current validation practices assume that reference data represent the truth, our ability to reliably demonstrate compliance with product uncertainty requirements through conformity testing is limited. The Fiducial Reference Measurements for Vegetation (FRM4VEG) project, initiated by the European Space Agency, is aiming to address this challenge by applying metrological principles to vegetation and surface reﬂectance product validation. Following FRM principles, and in accordance with the International Standards Organisation’s (ISO) Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), for the ﬁrst time, we describe an end-to-end uncertainty evaluation framework for reference data of two key vegetation bio-geophysical variables: the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). The process involves quantifying the uncertainties associated with individual in situ reference measurements and incorporating these uncertainties within the upscaling procedure (as well as those associated with the high-spatialresolution imagery used for upscaling). The framework was demonstrated in two ﬁeld campaigns covering agricultural crops (Las Tiesas–Barrax, Spain) and deciduous broadleaf forest (Wytham Woods, UK). Providing high-spatial-resolution reference maps with per-pixel uncertainty estimates, the framework is applicable to a range of other bio-geophysical variables including leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of vegetation cover (FCOVER), and canopy water content (CWC). The proposed procedures will facilitate conformity testing of moderate spatial resolution vegetation bio-geophysical products in future validation exercises.},

We summarize the history of global NPP science, as well as the derivation of this calculation, and current data production activity. The first data on NPP from the EOS (Earth Observing System) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor are presented with different types of validation. We offer examples of how this new type of data set can serve ecological science, land management, and environmental policy. To enhance the use of these data by nonspecialists, we are now producing monthly anomaly maps for GPP and annual NPP that compare the current value with an 18-year average value for each pixel, clearly identifying regions where vegetation growth is higher or lower than normal.},

Established towards the end of 2010, it provides access to satellite and other ancillary data, cloud computing, and algorithms for processing large amounts of data with relative ease. However, the uptake and usage of the opportunity remains varied and unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the usage patterns of the Google Earth Engine platform and whether researchers in developing countries were making use of the opportunity. Analysis of published literature showed that a total of 300 journal papers were published between 2011 and June 2017 that used GEE in their research, spread across 158 journals. The highest number of papers were in the journal Remote Sensing, followed by Remote Sensing of Environment. There were also a number of papers in premium journals such as Nature and Science. The application areas were quite varied, ranging from forest and vegetation studies to medical ﬁelds such as malaria. Landsat was the most widely used dataset; it is the biggest component of the GEE data portal, with data from the ﬁrst to the current Landsat series available for use and download. Examination of data also showed that the usage was dominated by institutions based in developed nations, with study sites mainly in developed nations. There were very few studies originating from institutions based in less developed nations and those that targeted less developed nations, particularly in the African continent.},

We used GPP ﬂux data from 21 global FLUXNET sites across main global biomes (forest, grassland, and cropland) and derived MODIS NDVI at contrasting spatial resolutions (between 0.5 × 0.5 km and 3.5 × 3.5 km) centered at ﬂux tower location. The goodness of the relationship between NDVIis and NDVIMD varied across biomes, sites, and MODIS spatial resolutions. We found a strong relationship with a low variability across sites and within year variability in deciduous broadleaf forests and a poor correlation in evergreen forests. Best performances were obtained for the highest spatial resolution at 0.5 × 0.5 km). Both NDVIis and NDVIMD elicited roughly three weeks later the starting of the growing season compared to GPP data. Our results conﬁrm that to improve the accuracy of upscaling in situ data of site GPP seasonal responses, in situ radiation measurement biomes should use larger ﬁeld of view to sense an area, or more sensors should be placed in the ﬂux footprint area to allow optimal match with satellite sensor pixel size.},

	abstract = {Satellite remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) products are widely used in landsurface monitoring and modeling, especially for estimating global terrestrial photosynthetic activity through light use eﬃciency (LUE) models. PAR absorbed by active chlorophyll (APARchl) is directly linked to vegetation photosynthesis and can be used to estimate ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). Previous studies have demonstrated that solar induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence has very tight relationship with APARchl at various ecosystems. Therefore, the solar angle normalized SIF (nSIF) is directly related to the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll (FPARchl). This paper intercompared six space FPAR products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). Their potential relationships with FPARchl were indirectly evaluated with both spaceborne (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, OCO-2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, TROPOMI) and airborne (Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer, CFIS) nSIF data as well as in situ GPP measurements. Our results show that these FPAR products are diﬀerent in terms of amplitudes and seasonal variations across biomes. Among six FPAR products, OLCI FPAR shows the best relationships with TROPOMI nSIF740, OCO-2 nSIF757, and CFIS nSIF755. The coeﬃcient of determination (R2) for the relationship between OLCI FPAR and TROPOMI nSIF740 is 0.79 ± 0.17 on a global average. APAR calculated from OLCI also exhibits the best relationship (R2 = 0.79) with in situ GPP over 25 ﬂux towers.},

	abstract = {Although satellite-based light use efficiency (LUE) model is widely used to estimate gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems, microwave observations have not been integrated into LUE models. This study developed a new LUE model coupled with a passive microwave vegetation index (Emissivity Difference Vege­ tation Index, EDVI) for daily GPP estimation. Normalized EDVI (nEDVI), an indicator of canopy-scale leaf development and biomass change, was used as a proxy of fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR). EDVI-based evaporative fraction (EDVI-EF) under all sky was used to indicate synoptic-scale water stress on LUE. 8-year in-situ measurements from seven flux tower sites (four forests, two grasslands and one croplands) of ChinaFLUX network were used to evaluate the model. We found that nEDVI-based FPAR better captured the short-term variations in daily in-situ GPP (GPPobs) than other optic-based FPAR schemes. This capability of nEDVI was more noticeable under moderate and heavy cloud cover (Frc) conditions. Validations against daily GPPobs at all sites showed that EDVI-based GPP (GPPEDVI) generated an overall small bias of − 0.47 gC m− 2 day− 1 (− 8.1\%) and good Taylor score (S) of 0.86 at the daily scale. Better accuracy of GPPEDVI was found at forests sites with R2 of 0.43 to 0.73, bias of-5.29\% to 3.03\% and S of 0.58 to 0.78, respectively. At a tropical forest site with most frequent cloud cover, the model also well captured the variation in GPPobs from clear sky to cloudy sky (R2 of 0.93) with stable accuracies. Furthermore, the accuracy of daily GPPEDVI was found to be comparable with global satellite optic MOD17 GPP (GPPMOD17) and EC-LUE GPP (GPPECLUE) from 8-day to yearly scales across the sites. In particular, GPPEDVI performed generally smaller bias at evergreen broadleaf forests, while both of GPPMOD17 and GPPECLUE were overestimated, suggesting that there could be less saturation for microwave-based LUE model over dense vegetation. Although all three satellite LUE models severely underestimated GPP of crop, GPPEDVI generated lower bias (− 29.8\%) than GPPMOD17 (− 66.8\%) and GPPECLUE (− 59.5\%). Overall, this study is the first attempt toward the integration of microwave-derived variables into LUE model for daily GPP estimation. The microwave-based LUE model has a potential of mapping spatiotemporally continues daily GPP under various clouds.},

	abstract = {With a growing number of Earth observation (EO) products available through operational programmes such as the European Union’s Copernicus, there is increasing emphasis on product accuracy and uncertainty, necessitating evaluation against in situ reference measurements. Whilst existing reference datasets have proven a valuable resource, they incorporate little data with which products from recent EO instruments can be assessed. A reliance on individual field campaigns has also led to several inconsistencies, whilst limiting the extent to which temporal variations in EO product performance can be captured. Recently established environmental monitoring networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which collect routine in situ measurements using standardised instruments and protocols, provide a promising opportunity in this respect. The Copernicus Ground Based Observations for Validation (GBOV) service was initiated in recognition of this fact. In the first component of the project, raw observations from existing networks have been collected and processed to provide reference data for a range of EO land products. In this study, we focus on leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). Raw digital hemispherical photography (DHP) from twenty NEON sites was processed to derive in situ reference measurements, which were then upscaled to provide high spatial resolution reference maps. Using these data, we assess the recently released Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) 300 m Version 1 (V1) products derived from PROBA-V, in addition to existing products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). When evaluated against reference data, the CGLS 300 m V1 product demonstrated the best agreement (RMSD = 0.57 for LAI and 0.08 for FAPAR), followed by the Collection 6 VNP15A2H and MOD15A2H products (RMSD = 0.81 to 0.89 for LAI and 0.12 for FAPAR). Differing assumptions of the products and in situ reference measurements, which cause them to be sensitive to slightly different quantities, are thought to explain apparent biases over sparse vegetation and forest environments. To ensure their continued utility, future work should focus on updating the GBOV in situ reference measurements, implementing additional corrections, and improving their geographical representativeness.},

	abstract = {The Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI) is widely used to monitor vegetation phenology and productivity around the world. Over the last few decades, phenology monitoring at large scales has been possible due to the information and metrics derived from satellite sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) or the Project for On-Board Autonomy–Vegetation (PROBA-V). However, due to their temporal and spatial resolution, adequate ground comparison is lacking. In this paper, we analyze how NDVI products from MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and PROBA-V predict vegetation phenology when compared with near-surface observations. We conduct this comparison at four tropical dry forests (TDFs) in the Americas. We undertake this study by comparing the following: (i) Dissimilarities of the standardized NDVI (NDVIS) using dynamic time warping, (ii) the diﬀerences of daily NDVIS between seasons and ENSO months using generalized linear models, and (iii) phenometrics derived from NDVI time series. Overall, our results suggest that NDVIS from satellite observations present DTW distances (dissimilarities) between 2.98 and 46.57 (18.91 ± 12.31) when compared with near-surface observations. Furthermore, NDVIS comparisons reveal that overall diﬀerences between satellite and near-surface observations are close to zero, but this tends to diﬀer between seasons or when El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is present. Phenometrics comparisons show that metrics derived from satellite observations such as green-up, maturity, and start and end of the wet season strongly correlate with those from near-surface observations. In contrast, phenometrics that describe the day of the highest or lowest NDVI tend to be inconsistent with those from near-surface observations. All ﬁndings were observed independently of the NDVI source. Our results suggest that satellite-based NDVI products tend to be inconsistent descriptors of vegetation events on tropical deciduous forests in comparison with near-surface observations. These results reinforce the idea that satellite-based NDVI products should be used and interpreted with great caution and only in ecosystems with well-established knowledge of their vegetation phenology.},

	abstract = {Tropical dry forests (TDFs) present strong seasonal greenness signals ideal for tracking phenology and primary productivity using remote sensing techniques. The tightly synchronized relationship these ecosystems have with water availability offer a valuable natural experiment for observing the complex interactions between the atmosphere and the biosphere in the tropics. To investigate how well the MODIS vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI)) represented the phenology of different successional stages of naturally regenerating TDFs, within a widely conserved forest fragment in the semi-arid southeast of Brazil, we installed several canopy towers with radiometric sensors to produce high temporal resolution near-surface vegetation greenness indices. Direct comparison of several years of ground measurements with a combined Aqua/Terra 8 day satellite product showed similar broad temporal trends, but MODIS often suffered from cloud contamination during the onset of the growing season and occasionally during the peak growing season. The strength of the in-situ and MODIS linear relationship was greater for NDVI than for EVI across sites but varied with forest stand age. Furthermore, we describe the onset dates and duration of canopy development phases for three years of in-situ monitoring. A seasonality analysis revealed signiﬁcant discrepancies between tower and MODIS phenology transitions dates, with up to ﬁve weeks differences in growing season length estimation. Our results indicate that 8 and 16 day MODIS satellite vegetation monitoring products are suitable for tracking general patterns of tropical dry forest phenology in this region but are not temporally sufﬁcient to characterize inter-annual differences in phenology phase onset dates or changes in productivity due to mid-season droughts. Such rapid transitions in canopy greenness are important indicators of climate change sensitivity of these already endangered forest ecosystems and should be further monitored using both ground and satellite approaches.},

	abstract = {The variability in land surface heat (H), water vapor (LE), and CO2 (or net ecosystem exchange, NEE) ¯uxes was investigated at scales ranging from fractions of seconds to years using eddy-covariance ¯ux measurements above a pine forest. Because these ¯uxes signi®cantly vary at all these time scales and because large gaps in the record are unavoidable in such experiments, standard Fourier expansion methods for computing the spectral and cospectral statistical properties were not possible. Instead, orthonormal wavelet transformations OWT are proposed and used. The OWT are ideal at resolving process variability with respect to both scale and time and are able to isolate and remove the eects of missing data (or gaps) from spectral and cospectral calculations. Using the OWT spectra, we demonstrated unique aspects in three appropriate ranges of time scales: turbulent time scales (fractions of seconds to minutes), meteorological time scales (hour to weeks), and seasonal to interannual time scales corresponding to climate and vegetation dynamics. We have shown that: (1) existing turbulence theories describe the short time scales well, (2) coupled physiological and transport models (e.g. CANVEG) reproduce the wavelet spectral characteristics of all three land surface ¯uxes for meteorological time scales, and (3) seasonal dynamics in vegetation physiology and structure inject strong correlations between land surface ¯uxes and forcing variables at monthly to seasonal time scales. The broad implications of this study center on the possibility of developing low-dimensional models of land surface water, energy, and carbon exchange. If the bulk of the ¯ux variability is dominated by a narrow band or bands of modes, and these modes ``resonate'' with key state and forcing variables, then low-dimensional models may relate these forcing and state variables to NEE and LE.

It is essential to provide researchers and land managers for biological invasion science and management with accurate information of the distribution of invasive alien species and their dynamics. Remotely sensed data that reveal spatial distribution of the earth’s surface features/objects provide great potential for this purpose. Consistent satellite monitoring of alien invasive plants is often diﬃcult because of lack of suﬃcient spectral contrast between them and co-occurring plants species. Time series analysis of spectral properties of the species can reveal timing of their variations among adjacent species. This information can improve accuracy of invasive species discrimination and mapping using remote sensing data at large scale. We sought to identify and better understand the optimal time window and key spectral features suﬃcient to detect invasive Acacia trees in heterogeneous forested landscape in South Africa. We explored one-year (January to December 2018) time series spectral bands and vegetation indices derived from optical Copernicus Sentinel-2 data. The attributes correspond to geographical information of invasive Acacia and native species recorded during a ﬁeld survey undertaken from 21 February to 25 February 2018 over Kwa-Zulu Natal grasslands landscape, in South Africa.

In the form of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), these data greatly beneﬁt environmental studies. However, their usefulness is compromised by sensor differences. This study investigates the global NDVI difference and its spatiotemporal patterns among typical moderate-resolution sensors, as supported by state-of-the-art remote sensing derived products. Our study demonstrates that the atmosphere plays a secondary role to LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) in inter-sensor NDVI differences. With reference to AVHRR/3, AVHRR/1 and 2 exhibit negative NDVI biases for vegetated land cover types. In summer (July), the area of negative bias shifts northward, and the magnitude increases in the Northern Hemisphere. For most LULC types, the bias generally shifts in the negative direction from winter (January) to summer. A linear regression of the NDVI difference versus NDVI shows a close correlation between the slope value and vegetation phenology. Overall, NDVI differences are controlled by LULC type and vegetation phenology. Our study can be used to generate a long-term, consistent NDVI data set from composite MODIS and AVHRR NDVI data. LULC-dependent and temporally variable correction equations are recommended to reduce intersensor NDVI differences.},

	abstract = {Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observed by satellites has advanced the monitoring of terrestrial photosynthesis regionally and globally. The relationship between SIF and gross primary production (GPP) at leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales has received tremendous attention in recent years. It remains controversial whether the SIF-GPP relationship at the ecosystem scale is universal or dependent upon vegetation type. New SIF observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution provide a new opportunity to elucidate the SIF-GPP relationship. Here, we examine the SIFGPP relationship for seven major vegetation types across the U.S. with TROPOMI SIF and in-situ GPP data for 83 eddy covariance flux sites. We find that TROPOMI SIF shows a strong and consistent relationship with towerbased GPP at both satellite footprint and grid-cell levels. The slope of the SIF-GPP relationship is similar among all the vegetation types except croplands, demonstrating a nearly universal (converging to {\textasciitilde}13.5 g C m− 2 d− 1/W m− 2 μm− 1 sr− 1) rather than vegetation type-specific SIF-GPP relationship. This confirms that TROPOMI SIF can be used as a proxy for GPP across a wide variety of vegetation types, and can also be used to quantify GPP by avoiding uncertainty associated with land cover maps. The C4 crops have a much higher slope than the C3 crops, and therefore croplands tend to have a higher slope than C3-dominated vegetation types (e.g., forests, shrublands, savannas). We also find that the TROPOMI SIF is well correlated with GPP under normal or wetter conditions, while their relationship becomes weaker under water stress. Our TROPOMI-based study could improve our understanding of the SIF-GPP relationship at the ecosystem scale and advance the mapping of GPP globally with SIF observations from space.},

	abstract = {In recent years, solar-induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (SIF) retrieved from spaceborne spectrometers has been extensively used as a proxy for terrestrial photosynthesis at relatively sparse temporal and spatial scales. The near-infrared band of the recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) features the required spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to retrieve SIF in a spectral range devoid of atmospheric absorption features. We ﬁnd that initial TROPOMI spectra meet high expectations for a substantially improved spatiotemporal resolution (up to 7-km × 3.5-km pixels with daily revisit), representing a step change in SIF remote sensing capabilities. However, interpretation requires caution, as the broad range of viewing-illumination geometries covered by TROPOMI’s 2,600-km-wide swath needs to be taken into account. A ﬁrst intersensor comparison with OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2) SIF shows excellent agreement, underscoring the high quality of TROPOMI’s SIF retrievals and the notable radiometric performance of the instrument.},

	abstract = {Light use efficiency (LUE) models, mainly including the big-leaf (BL) and two-leaf (TL) categories, are efficient approaches to simulate gross primary productivity (GPP). Recently, a TL LUE model considering a radiation scalar (RTL-LUE) was developed, which improved the GPP simulation and unified the same model structure with the BL models using only one maximum LUE. However, whether the radiation scalar is suitable for BL models is still unknown yet, and the core parameters of maximum LUE in the BL and TL models have not been fairly compared before. In this study, we step forward to modifying the MOD17 model using the radiation scalar (RMOD17), and compare the GPP simulations and maximum LUEs in BL (MOD17, RMOD17) and TL (RTL-LUE) models at global 169 FLUXNET eddy covariance (EC) sites. Results indicate that the GPP estimation from RMOD17 (R2=0.72) matches better with EC GPP than those from the original MOD17 (R2=0.65), because the radiation scalar effectively corrects the underestimations or overestimations in low or high photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) ranges caused by the radiation-independent LUE in MOD17. The RTL-LUE can further improve the accuracy (R2=0.74) by alleviating the GPP underestimation of BL RMOD17 in high productivity ranges, which is mainly caused by the insufficient consideration of the shaded leaves contributions. The maximum LUE from RMOD17 and RTL-LUE both show more reasonable values and lower diurnal variations than MOD17, and further analysis proves the radiation scalar is the main reason for this. Besides, RTL-LUE presents a lower model parameter sensitivity compared to RMOD17, indicating that TL is a more robust strategy than BL to simulate GPP. This study highlights the importance of considering a radiation scalar and two-leaf strategy in GPP simulation in LUE models, to better describe the multi-order impacts of radiation on vegetation photosynthesis.},

Here we report the spatiotemporal consistency between TROPOMI SIF and vegetation indices from the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) adjusted (MCD43) and standard MODIS (MOD09) surface reflectance products, estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation by chlorophyll (APARchl) derived from National Centers for Environmental Prediction Reanalysis-2 (NCEP2), MODIS MCD18, and European Reanalysis (ERA5) data, and two GPP products (GPPVPM and GPPMOD17). We find (a) non-adjusted VIs were more highly correlated with SIF at mid and high latitude than BRDFadjusted VIs, but were less correlated in the tropics, (b) negligible differences in the correlation between SIF and non-adjusted NIRv and EVI, but BRDF-adjusted NIRv had higher correlations with SIF at mid to high latitude than BRDF-adjusted EVI but lower correlations in the tropics, (c) choice of PAR data set likely to cause substantial differences in global and regional GPP estimates and the correlation between modeled GPP and SIF, (d) SIF was more highly correlated with APARchl at high to mid latitude than EVI but more highly correlated with EVI at lower latitudes, and (e) GPPVPM is more highly correlated with SIF than GPPMOD17, except in sub-Sahara Africa. Our results highlight that spaceborne photosynthesis would likely be improved by using a non-linear response to PAR and that the fundamental differences between the vegetation indices and PAR data sets are likely to yield important differences in global and regional estimates of photosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Disentangling the individual contributions from vegetation and soil in measured canopy reflectance is a grand challenge to the remote sensing and ecophysiology communities. Since Solar Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is uniquely emitted from vegetation, it can be used to evaluate how well reflectance-based vegetation indices (VIs) can separate the vegetation and soil components. Due to the residual soil background contributions, Near-infrared (NIR) reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) and Difference Vegetation index (DVI) present offsets when compared to SIF (i.e., the value of NIRv or DVI is non-zero when SIF is zero). In this study, we proposed a simple framework for estimating the true NIR reflectance of vegetation from Hyperspectral measurements (NIRvH) with minimal soil impacts. NIRvH takes advantage of the spectral shape variations in the red-edge region to minimize the soil effects. We evaluated the capability of NIRvH, NIRv and DVI in isolating the true NIR reflectance of vegetation using the data from both the model-based simulations and Hyperspectral Plant imaging spectrometer (HyPlant) measurements. Benchmarked by simultaneously measured SIF, NIRvH has the smallest offset (0–0.037), as compared to an intermediate offset of 0.047–0.062 from NIRv, and the largest offset of 0.089–0.112 from DVI. The magnitude of the offset can vary with different soil reflectance spectra across spatio-temporal scales, which may lead to bias in the downstream NIRv-based photosynthesis estimates. NIRvH and SIF mea­ surements from the same sensor platform avoided complications due to different geometry, footprint and time of observation across sensors when studying the radiative transfer of reflected photons and SIF. In addition, NIRvH was primarily determined by canopy structure rather than chlorophyll content and soil brightness. Our work showcases that NIRvH is promising for retrieving canopy structure parameters such as leaf area index and leaf inclination angle, and for estimating fluorescence yield with current and forthcoming hyperspectral satellite measurements.},

	abstract = {Great advances have been made in the last decade in quantifying and understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) with ground, atmospheric, and space observations. However, although global GPP estimates exist, each data set relies upon assumptions and none of the available data are based only on measurements. Consequently, there is no consensus on the global total GPP and large uncertainties exist in its benchmarking. The objective of this review is to assess how the different available data sets predict the spatiotemporal patterns of GPP, identify the differences among data sets, and highlight the main advantages/disadvantages of each data set. We compare GPP estimates for the historical period (1990–2009) from two observation-based data sets (Model Tree Ensemble and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to coupled carbon-climate models and terrestrial carbon cycle models from the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project and TRENDY projects and to a new hybrid data set (CARBONES). Results show a large range in the mean global GPP estimates. The different data sets broadly agree on GPP seasonal cycle in terms of phasing, while there is still discrepancy on the amplitude. For interannual variability (IAV) and trends, there is a clear separation between the observation-based data that show little IAV and trend, while the process-based models have large GPP variability and signiﬁcant trends. These results suggest that there is an urgent need to improve observation-based data sets and develop carbon cycle modeling with processes that are currently treated either very simplistically to correctly estimate present GPP and better quantify the future uptake of carbon dioxide by the world’s vegetation.},

	abstract = {The accurate quantiﬁcation of gross primary productivity (GPP) has been a major challenge in global climate change research. Satellite data-driven models have been universally used as scientiﬁc tools for investigating the carbon cycle, including vegetation index (VI)-based models, light use eﬃciency (LUE) models, and process-based models. However, inconsistencies and uncertainties have been found in the GPP estimations from various models. The understanding of model behaviors under diﬀerent climatic conditions remains unclear. In this study, three typical satellite data-driven models, namely, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP (MOD17) model, Temperature and Greenness (TG) model and Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS), respectively, were compared to better understand discrepancies and uncertainties in GPP estimations at 119 northern eddy covariance (EC) sites. Due to the variations in climatic drivers of GPP, temperature, precipitation and incoming solar radiation were selected to describe climatic conditions. The results showed that BEPS and MOD17 exhibited similar performance in simulating GPP, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 2.50 g C m−2 d−1 and 2.53 g C m−2 d−1, respectively, and performed slightly better than TG (RMSE = 2.98 g C m−2 d−1). Comparison between simulated GPP and EC GPP also revealed that model performance varied substantially among diﬀerent vegetation types. The three models performed better for deciduous broadleaf forest, evergreen needleleaf forest, and mixed forest, in comparison to the results from evergreen broadleaf forest and crop. Speciﬁcally, all three models showed poor performance under the conditions of high temperature and low precipitation, revealing the models’ inability to characterize the impact of water stress on photosynthesis when drought occurs. Furthermore, our results indicated that GPP estimations from satellite data-driven models were also sensitive to remotely sensed data, suggesting that the high accuracy of remotely sensed data in describing vegetation canopy is important for carbon modeling. This study highlights the importance of understanding model behaviors in diﬀerent vegetation types and climatic conditions, so that the model performances may be improved in future carbon cycle studies.},

	abstract = {We conducted an ensemble modeling exercise using the Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) to evaluate sources of uncertainty in carbon ﬂux estimates resulting from structural differences among ecosystem models. The experiment ran public-domain versions of BIOME-BGC, LPJ, CASA, and TOPS-BGC over North America at 8 km resolution and for the period of 1982–2006. We developed the Hierarchical Framework for Diagnosing Ecosystem Models (HFDEM) to separate the simulated biogeochemistry into a cascade of three functional tiers and sequentially examine their characteristics in climate (temperature–precipitation) and other spaces. Analysis of the simulated annual gross primary production (GPP) in the climate domain indicates a general agreement among the models, all showing optimal GPP in regions where the relationship between annual average temperature (T, 1C) and annual total precipitation (P, mm) is deﬁned by P 5 50T 1 500. However, differences in simulated GPP are identiﬁed in magnitudes and distribution patterns. For forests, the GPP gradient along P 5 50T 1 500 ranges from \$50 g C yrÀ1 mÀ2 1CÀ1 (CASA) to \$125 g C yrÀ1 mÀ2 1CÀ1 (BIOME-BGC) in cold/temperate regions; for nonforests, the diversity among GPP distributions is even larger. Positive linear relationships are found between annual GPP and annual mean leaf area index (LAI) in all models. For BIOME-BGC and LPJ, such relationships lead to a positive feedback from LAI growth to GPP enhancement. Different approaches to constrain this feedback lead to different sensitivity of the models to disturbances such as ﬁre, which contribute signiﬁcantly to the diversity in GPP stated above. The ratios between independently simulated NPP and GPP are close to 50\% on average; however, their distribution patterns vary signiﬁcantly between models, reﬂecting the difﬁculties in estimating autotrophic respiration across various climate regimes. Although these results are drawn from our experiments with the tested model versions, the developed methodology has potential for other model exercises.},

Previous work has shown that the remote sensing based greenness and radiation (GR) model can give accurate GPP estimates in crops. However, the feasibility of its application and the model calibration to other ecosystems remain unknown. With the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and the surface based estimates of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), we provide an analysis of the GR model for estimating monthly GPP using ﬂux measurements at ﬁfteen sites, representing a wide range of ecosystems with various canopy structures and climate characteristics. Results demonstrate that the GR model can provide better estimates of GPP than that of the temperature and greenness (TG) model for the overall data classiﬁed as non-forest (NF), deciduous forest (DF) and evergreen forest (EF) sites. Calibration of the GR model is also conducted and has shown reasonable results for all sites with a root mean square error of 47.18 g C/m2/month. Different coefﬁcients acquired for the three plant functional types indicate that there are shifts of importance among various factors that determine the monthly vegetation GPP. The analysis ﬁrstly shows the potential use of the GR model in estimating GPP across biomes while it also points to the needs of further considerations in future operational applications.},

Satellite-based geometry-adjusted reflectances are from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and provide information about vegetation structure and chlorophyll content at both high temporal (daily to monthly) and spatial (∼1 km) resolution. We use satellite-derived solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) to identify regions of high productivity crops and also evaluate the use of downscaled SIF to estimate GPP. We calibrate a set of our satellite-based models with GPP estimates from a subset of distributed eddy covariance flux towers (FLUXNET 2015). The results of the trained models are evaluated using an independent subset of FLUXNET 2015 GPP data. We show that variations in light-use efficiency (LUE) with incident PAR are important and can be easily incorporated into the models. Unlike many LUE-based models, our satellite-based GPP estimates do not use an explicit parameterization of LUE that reduces its value from the potential maximum under limiting conditions such as temperature and water stress. Even without the parameterized downward regulation, our simplified models are shown to perform as well as or better than state-of-the-art satellite data-driven products that incorporate such parameterizations. A significant fraction of both spatial and temporal variability in GPP across plant functional types can be accounted for using our satellite-based models. Our results provide an annual GPP value of ∼140 Pg C year−1 for 2007 that is within the range of a compilation of observation-based, model, and hybrid results, but is higher than some previous satellite observation-based estimates.},

	abstract = {Accurately monitoring global vegetation dynamics with modern remote sensing is critical for understanding the functions and processes of the biosphere and its interactions with the planetary climate. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) product has been a primary data source for this purpose. To date, the MODIS team had released several versions of VI products that have widely used in global change studies and practical applications. In this study, we re-examined the global vegetation activity by comparing the recent MODIS Collection 6 (C6) VIs with Collection 5 (C5) VIs including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Terra (2001–2015) and Aqua Satellites (2003–2015). We found substantial differences in global vegetation trends betweenTerra-C5 and -C6 VIs, especially EVI. From 2001 to 2015, global vegetation showed a remarkable greening trend in annual EVI from the Terra-C6 (0.28\% year−1; P b 0.001), in contrast to the decreasing EVI trend from the Terra-C5 (−0.14\% year−1, P b 0.01). Spatially, large portions of the browning areas in tropical regions identiﬁed by Terra-C5 VIs were not evident in Terra-C6 VIs. In contrast, the widespread greening areas in Terra-C6 VIs were consistent with AquaC6 VIs and GIMMS3g NDVI. Our ﬁnding of a greening Earth supports the recent studies suggesting an enhanced land carbon sink. Our study suggests that most of the vegetation browning trends detected by MODIS Terra-C5 VIs were likely caused by sensor degradation, particularly for the period after 2007. Therefore, previous studies of temporal vegetation trends based solely on Terra-C5 VIs may need to be reevaluated. Our new analysis offers the most updated understanding of the global vegetation dynamics during the past 15 years and contributes to accurately understanding the role of vegetation played in the Earth's biogeochemical and climatic systems.},

Here we ﬁnd that near-infrared radiance of vegetation (NIRv,Rad), deﬁned as the product of observed NIR radiance and normalized difference vegetation index, can accurately estimate corn and soybean GPP at daily and half-hourly time scales, benchmarked with multi-year tower-based GPP at three sites with different environmental and irrigation conditions. Overall, NIRv,Rad explains 84\% and 78\% variations of half-hourly GPP for corn and soybean, respectively, outperforming NIR reﬂectance of vegetation (NIRv,Ref), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and far-red solar-induced ﬂuorescence (SIF760). The strong linear relationship between NIRv,Rad and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation by green leaves (APARgreen), and that between APARgreen and GPP, explain the good NIRv,Rad-GPP relationship. The NIRv,Rad-GPP relationship is robust and consistent across sites. The scalability and simplicity of NIRv,Rad indicate a great potential to estimate daily or sub-daily GPP from high-resolution and/or long-term satellite remote sensing data.},

	abstract = {Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a promising new tool for remotely estimating photosynthesis. However, the degree to which incoming solar radiation and the structure of the canopy rather than leaf phys­ iology contribute to SIF variations is still not well characterized. Therefore, we investigated relationships be­ tween SIF and variables that at least partly capture the canopy structure component of SIF. For this, we relied on high-quality SIF observations from ground-based instruments, high-resolution airborne SIF imagery and the most recent satellite SIF products to cover large ranges in spatial and temporal resolution and diverse ecosystems. We found that the canopy structure-related near-infrared reflectance of vegetation multiplied by incoming sunlight (NIRVP) is a robust proxy for far-red SIF across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Our findings indicate that contributions from leaf physiology to SIF variability are small compared to the structure and radiation components. Also, NIRVP captured spatio-temporal patterns of canopy photosynthesis better than SIF, which seems to be mostly due to the greater retrieval noise of SIF. Compared to other relevant structural SIF proxies, NIRVP showed more robust relationships to SIF, especially at the global scale. Our results highlight the promise of using widely available NIRVP data for vegetation monitoring and also indicate the potential of using SIF and NIRVP in combination to extract physiological information from SIF.},

	abstract = {Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as a leading approach for remote sensing of gross primary productivity (GPP). While SIF has an intrinsic, underlying relationship with canopy light capture and light use efficiency, these physiological relationships are obscured by the fact that satellites observe a small and variable fraction of total emitted canopy SIF. Upon emission, most SIF photons are reabsorbed or scattered within the canopy, preventing their observation remotely. The complexities of the radiative transfer process, which vary across time and space, limit our ability to reliably infer physiological processes from SIF observations. Here, we propose an approach for estimating the fraction of total emitted near-infrared SIF (760 nm) photons that escape the canopy by combining the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), two widely available remote sensing products. Our approach relies on the fact that NIRV is resilient against soil background contamination, allowing us to reliably calculate the bidirectional reflectance factor of vegetation, which in turn conveys information about the escape ratio of SIF photons. Our NIRV-based approach explains variations in the escape ratio with an R2 of 0.91 and an RMSE of 1.48\% across a series of simulations where canopy structure, soil brightness, and sun-sensor-canopy geometry are varied. The approach is applicable to conditions of low leaf area index and fractional vegetation cover. We show that correcting for the escape ratio of SIF using NIRV provides robust estimates of total emitted SIF, providing for the possibility of studying physiological variations of fluorescence yield at the global scale.},

	abstract = {Light use efﬁciency (LUE) is an important variable characterizing plant eco-physiological functions and refers to the efﬁciency at which absorbed solar radiation is converted into photosynthates. The estimation of LUE at regional to global scales would be a signiﬁcant advantage for global carbon cycle research. Traditional methods for canopy level LUE determination require meteorological inputs which cannot be easily obtained by remote sensing. Here we propose a new algorithm that incorporates the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and a modiﬁed form of land surface temperature (Tm) for the estimation of monthly forest LUE based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. Results demonstrate that a model based on EVI × Tm parameterized from ten forest sites can provide reasonable estimates of monthly LUE for temperate and boreal forest ecosystems in North America with an R2 of 0.51 (p b 0.001) for the overall dataset. The regression coefﬁcients (a, b) of the LUE–EVI × Tm correlation for these ten sites have been found to be closely correlated with the average EVI (EVI\_ave, R2 = 0.68, p = 0.003) and the minimum land surface temperature (LST\_min, R2 = 0.81, p = 0.009), providing a possible approach for model calibration. The calibrated model shows comparably good estimates of LUE for another ten independent forest ecosystems with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.055 g C per mol photosynthetically active radiation. These results are especially important for the evergreen species due to their limited variability in canopy greenness. The usefulness of this new LUE algorithm is further validated for the estimation of gross primary production (GPP) at these sites with an RMSE of 37.6 g C m−2 month−1 for all observations, which reﬂects a 28\% improvement over the standard MODIS GPP products. These analyses should be helpful in the further development of ecosystem remote sensing methods and improving our understanding of the responses of various ecosystems to climate change.},

	abstract = {Remotely sensed sun-induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (SIF) has been used as an indicator of global terrestrial vegetation photosynthesis. The connection between SIF and photosynthesis allows its use for improving estimates of gross primary production (GPP) and monitoring plant stress. In these analyses, up-scaling of the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis from the photosynthetic level to the canopy, regional or global scale has been one of the main challenges. The scaling is strongly aﬀected by the radiative transfer of emitted SIF, notably scattering and re-absorption of SIF. It is essential to understand these processes in order to diﬀerentiate eﬀects of canopy structural variation from eﬀects of photosynthesis functional variation on SIF. In this study, we derive the relationship between canopy scattering of SIF and top-of-canopy (TOC) reﬂectance analytically, by investigating the radiative transfer of incident light and emitted SIF. The similarity of radiative transfer of intercepted incident light and emitted SIF results in a simple relationship between reﬂectance and canopy scattering of SIF. In particular, we ﬁnd that the ratio of far-red reﬂectance (R) to the product of canopy interceptance (i0) and leaf albedo (ω) is an accurate estimate of canopy scattering of far-red SIF (i.e., ).

	abstract = {Remotely sensed sun-induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (SIF) has been used as an indicator of global terrestrial vegetation photosynthesis. The connection between SIF and photosynthesis allows its use for improving estimates of gross primary production (GPP) and monitoring plant stress. In these analyses, up-scaling of the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis from the photosynthetic level to the canopy, regional or global scale has been one of the main challenges. The scaling is strongly aﬀected by the radiative transfer of emitted SIF, notably scattering and re-absorption of SIF. It is essential to understand these processes in order to diﬀerentiate eﬀects of canopy structural variation from eﬀects of photosynthesis functional variation on SIF. In this study, we derive the relationship between canopy scattering of SIF and top-of-canopy (TOC) reﬂectance analytically, by investigating the radiative transfer of incident light and emitted SIF. The similarity of radiative transfer of intercepted incident light and emitted SIF results in a simple relationship between reﬂectance and canopy scattering of SIF. In particular, we ﬁnd that the ratio of far-red reﬂectance (R) to the product of canopy interceptance (i0) and leaf albedo (ω) is an accurate estimate of canopy scattering of far-red SIF (i.e., ). SCOPE model simulations are used to validate our ﬁndings. The relationship we found provides an easy and accurate approach for rapid decoupling canopy structural and functional regulation of SIF, and correction of SIF for bidirectional eﬀects.

	abstract = {The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is an essential climate variable (ECV) widely used for various ecological and climate models. However, all the current FAPAR satellite products correspond to instantaneous FAPAR values acquired at the satellite transit time only, which cannot represent the variations in photosynthetic processes over the diurnal period. Most studies have directly used the instantaneous FAPAR as a reasonable approximation of the daily integrated value. However, clearly, FAPAR varies a lot according to the weather conditions and amount of incoming radiation. In this paper, a temporal upscaling method based on the cosine of the solar zenith angle (SZA) at local noon (cos(SZAnoon)) is proposed for converting instantaneous FAPAR to daily integrated FAPAR. First, the diurnal variations in FAPAR were investigated using PROSAIL (a model of Leaf Optical Properties Spectra (PROSPECT) integrating a canopy radiative transfer model (Scattering from Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves, SAIL)) simulations with diﬀerent leaf area index (LAI) values corresponding to diﬀerent latitudes. It was found that the instantaneous black sky FAPAR at 09:30 AM provided a good approximation for the daily integrated black sky FAPAR; this gave the highest correlation (R2 = 0.995) and lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.013) among the instantaneous black sky FAPAR values observed at diﬀerent times. Secondly, the diﬀerence between the instantaneous black sky FAPAR values acquired at diﬀerent times and the daily integrated black sky FAPAR was analyzed; this could be accurately modelled using the cosine value of solar zenith angle at local noon (cos(SZAnoon)) for a given vegetation scene. Therefore, a temporal upscaling method for typical satellite products was proposed using a cos(SZA)-based upscaling model. Finally, the proposed cos(SZA)-based upscaling model was validated using both the PROSAIL simulated data and the ﬁeld measurements. The validated results indicated that the upscaled daily black sky FAPAR was highly consistent with the daily integrated black sky FAPAR, giving very high mean R2 values (0.998, 0.972), low RMSEs (0.007, 0.014), and low rMAEs (0.596\%, 1.378\%) for the simulations and the ﬁeld measurements, respectively. Consequently, the cos(SZA)-based method performs well for upscaling the instantaneous black sky FAPAR to its daily value, which is a simple but extremely important approach for satellite remote sensing applications related to FAPAR.},

	abstract = {Carbon sequestration by forests is one of the vital ecosystem services regulating the global climate. Equally important are the socio-economic co-beneﬁts of carbon sequestration, given their implications for designing policies focused on conservation or restoration of tropical forests. Much debate has been around how to account for, and maximize, the co-beneﬁts of carbon sequestration. Prior research suggests that a better understanding of the spatial relationship between carbon sequestration potential and forest types and dynamics - as a function of geographical context and time - is needed to better estimate their socio-economic beneﬁts. Hence, this paper uses the Tropical Dry Forests of Central and South America to propose a new approach to quantify carbon sequestration of this biome, and its efﬁciency, using time series of the Terra-MODIS satellite. Our estimations of carbon sequestration are then coupled with a beneﬁt transfer approach to infer carbon sequestration’s monetary cost. Results reveal that these tropical forests sequester an annual average of 22.3 Æ 3.3 tCO2 ha-1 yr-1 or in total, 1.16 GtCO2. The associated social cost of carbon, calculated using three econometric models, ranges from USD 489 ha1 yr-1 to USD 2828 ha-1 yr-1. These results can open new perspectives regarding the beneﬁts of carbon sequestration against the costs of the negative impacts of climate change for national welfare accounts, their relevance for environmental policy-making, and the implementation or monitoring of carbon-based incentive programs (e.g., WAVES).},

Using TDF phenological characteristics as a proxy, this study aims to evaluate their current continental response to climate change across the Americas. Here, we show that TDFs are resilient to water stress and droughts by increasing their rain use efficiency (RUE) in drier years and recovering to average RUE in the year following the drought. Additionally, we find that TDF productivity trends over the past 18 years are spatially clustered, with sites in the northern hemisphere experiencing increased productivity, while equatorial regions have no change, and the southern hemisphere exhibiting decreased productivity. The results indicate that the TDF will be resilient under future climatic conditions, particularly if there are increasing drought conditions.},

	abstract = {Climate models predict that precipitation patterns in tropical dry forests (TDFs) will change, with an overall reduction in rainfall amount and intensiﬁcation of dry intervals, leading to greater susceptibility to drought. In this paper, we explore the effect of drought on phenology and carbon dynamics of a secondary TDF located in the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP), Costa Rica. Through the use of optical sensors and an eddy covariance ﬂux tower, seasonal phenology and carbon ﬂuxes were monitored over a four-year period (2013–2016). Over this time frame, annual precipitation varied considerably. Total precipitation amounts for the 2013–2016 seasons equaled 1591.8 mm (+14.4 mm SD), 1112.9 mm (+9.9 mm SD), 600.8 mm (+7.6 mm SD), and 1762.2 mm (+13.9 mm SD), respectively. The 2014 and 2015 (ENSO) seasonal precipitation amounts represent a 30\% and 63\% reduction in precipitation, respectively, and were designated as drought seasons. Phenology was affected by precipitation patterns and availability. The onset of green-up was closely associated with pre-seasonal rains. Drought events lead to seasonal NDVI minimums and changes in phenologic cycle length. Carbon ﬂuxes, assimilation, and photosynthetic light use efﬁciency were negatively affected by drought. Seasonal minimums in photosynthetic rates and light use efﬁciency were observed during drought events, and gross primary productivity was reduced by 13\% and 42\% during drought seasons 2014 and 2015, respectively. However, all four growth seasons were net carbon sinks. Results from this study contribute towards a deeper understanding of the impact of drought on TDF phenology and carbon dynamics.},

The accuracy of satellite FAPAR products directly inﬂuences estimates of ecosystem productivity and carbon stocks. The targeted accuracy of FAPAR products is 10\%, or 0.05, for many applications. It is important to evaluate satellite FAPAR products and understand differences between the products to effectively use them in carbon cycling models. In this study, ﬁve global FAPAR products, namely MODIS, MISR, MERIS, SeaWiFS, and GEOV1 are intercompared over different land covers and directly validated with ground-based measurements at VAlidation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments (VALERI) and AmeriFlux sites. Intercomparison results show that MODIS, MISR, and GEOV1 agree well with each other and so do MERIS and SeaWiFS, but the difference between these two groups can be as large as 0.1. The temporal trends of these products agree better with each other in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. The trends in the Northern Hemisphere are similar to those globally. However, the conclusions from the northern hemispheric scale could not be extended to the global scale for land covers such as savannahs and broadleaf evergreen forests. The differences between the products are consistent throughout the year over most of the land cover types, except over the forests, because of the different assumptions in the retrieval algorithms and the differences between green and total FAPAR products over forests. Direct validation results show that MERIS, MODIS, MISR, and GEOV1 FAPAR products have an uncertainty of 0.14 when validating with total FAPAR measurements, and 0.09 when validating with green FAPAR measurements. Overall, current FAPAR products are close to, but have not fulﬁlled, the accuracy requirement, and further improvements are still needed.},

Over 10 years ago, Landsat time series analyses were inevitably limited to a few expensive images from carefully selected acquisition dates. Yet, such a static selection may have introduced uncertainties when spatial or inter-annual variability in seasonal vegetation growth were large. As seminal pre-open-data-era papers are still heavily cited, variations of their workﬂows are still widely used, too. Thus, here we quantitatively assessed the level of agreement between an approach using carefully selected images and a state-of-the-art analysis that uses all available images. We reproduced a representative case study from the year 2003 that for the ﬁrst time used annual Landsat time series to assess long-term vegetation dynamics in a semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem in Crete, Greece. We replicated this assessment using all available data paired with a time series method based on land surface phenology metrics. Results differed fundamentally because the volatile timing of statically selected images relative to the phenological cycle introduced systematic uncertainty. We further applied lessons learned to arrive at a more nuanced and information-enriched vegetation dynamics description by decomposing vegetation cover into woody and herbaceous components, followed by a syndromebased classiﬁcation of change and trend parameters. This allowed for a more reliable interpretation of vegetation changes and even permitted us to disentangle certain land-use change processes with opposite trajectories in the vegetation components that were not observable when solely analyzing total vegetation cover. The long-term budget of net cover change revealed that vegetation cover of both components has increased at large and that this process was mainly driven by gradual processes. We conclude that study designs based on static image selection strategies should be critically evaluated in the light of current data availability, analytical capabilities, and with regards to the ecosystem under investigation. We recommend using all available data and taking advantage of phenology-based approaches that remove the selection bias and hence reduce uncertainties in results.},

            Land, atmosphere and climate interact constantly and at different spatial and temporal scales. In this paper we rely on causal discovery methods to infer spatial patterns of causal relations between several key variables of the carbon and water cycles: gross primary productivity, latent heat energy flux for evaporation, surface air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture and radiation. We introduce a methodology based on the convergent cross-mapping (CCM) technique. Despite its good performance in general, CCM is sensitive to (even moderate) noise levels and hyper-parameter selection. We present a robust CCM (RCCM) that relies on temporal bootstrapping decision scores and the derivation of more stringent cross-map skill scores. The RCCM method is combined with the information-geometric causal inference (IGCI) method to address the problem of strong and instantaneous variable coupling, another important and long-standing issue of CCM. The proposed methodology allows to derive spatially explicit global maps of causal relations between the involved variables and retrieve the underlying complexity of the interactions. Results are generally consistent with reported patterns and process understanding, and constitute a new way to quantify and understand carbon and water fluxes interactions.},

	abstract = {Estimating Gross Primary Production (GPP), the gross uptake of CO2 by vegetation, is a fundamental prerequisite for understanding and quantifying the terrestrial carbon cycle. Over the last decade, multiple approaches have been developed to derive spatio-temporal dynamics of GPP combining in-situ observations and remote sensing data using machine learning techniques or semi-empirical models. However, no high spatial resolution GPP product exists so far that is derived entirely from satellite-based remote sensing data. Sentinel-2 satellites are expected to open new opportunities to analyze ecosystem processes with spectral bands chosen to study vegetation between 10m to 20m spatial resolution with 5-days revisit frequency. Of particular relevance is the availability of red-edge bands that are suitable for deriving estimates of canopy chlorophyll content that are expected to be much better than any previous global mission. Here we analyzed whether red-edge-based and near-infraredbased vegetation indices (VIs) or machine learning techniques that consider VIs, all spectral bands and their non-linear interactions could predict daily GPP derived from 58 eddy covariance sites. Using linear regressions based on classic VIs, including Near Infrared Reflectance of Vegetation (NIRv), we achieved prediction powers of R120−fold = 0.51 and an RM SE10−fold = 2.95 [µmol CO2 m−2 s−1] in a 10-fold cross-validation. Chlorophyll Index Red (CIR), and the novel kernel NDVI (kNVDI) achieved significantly higher prediction powers of around R120−fold ≈ 0.61, and a RM SE10−fold ≈ 2.57 [µmol CO2 m−2 s−1]. Using all spectral bands and VIs jointly in a machine learning prediction framework allowed us to predict GPP with R120−fold = 0.71, and RM SE10−fold = 2.68 [µmol CO2 m−2 s−1]. Despite the highpower prediction when machine learning techniques are used, under water-stress scenarios or heat-waves, optical information alone is not enough to predict GPP properly. In general, our analyses show the potential of non-linear combinations of spectral bands and VIs for monitoring GPP across ecosystems at a level of accuracy comparable to previous works, which, however, required additional meteorological drivers.},

	abstract = {The exchanges of carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and energy were measured nearly continuously since 1996 over a mixed mature transition forest at the Borden Forest Research Station, in southern Ontario, Canada. Borden Forest, one of the longest running ﬂux towers in North America, is located in the temperate–boreal ecotone. This transitional region, which includes species close to the limits of their environmental range, may be particularly susceptible to changes in forest composition as a result of climate change. Here we analyze net CO2 exchange, measured using the eddy covariance method, and concurrent meteorological variables. The forest was found to be a low-to-moderate CO2 sink, with uptake of 177 ± 28 gC m−2 yr−1 (mean ± standard error). In two of the years, however, the forest was a weak CO2 source (i.e., 1996: −36 gC m−2 yr−1 and 2001: −35 gC m−2 yr−1), demonstrating that the forest can switch between source and sink. Over the 17 years of measurement, annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) increased by 15.7 gC m−2 yr−1 yr−1, due to a decline in ecosystem respiration of 4.2 gC m−2 yr−1 yr−1 and an increase in gross ecosystem productivity of 11.6 gC m−2 yr−1 yr−1. There were notable long-term indications of climatic warming: annual air temperature rose by 0.09 ◦C yr−1, while soil temperature increased by 0.08 ◦C yr−1. Photosynthetically active radiation and soil temperature were found to be the dominant environmental drivers of interannual variations and long-term trends in NEP; on seasonal or monthly time-scales, air temperature and precipitation also inﬂuenced CO2 uptake. NEP is positively correlated with the length of the net carbon uptake period, which varied from 111 to 164 days. The large interannual variations in CO2 ﬂux in this dataset demonstrate the need for long time series of CO2, water vapor, and energy ﬂuxes, together with meteorological measurements; such measurements show long-term trends, which can be used to understand and predict future changes in forest-atmosphere exchanges in response to anticipated changes in climate.},

	abstract = {Forested ecosystems represent an important part of the global carbon cycle, with accurate estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) crucial for understanding ecosystem response to environmental controls and improving global carbon models. This research investigated the relationships between leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (ChlLeaf) with forest carbon uptake. Ground measurements of LAI and ChlLeaf were taken approximately every 9 days across the 2013 growing season from day of year (DOY) 130 to 290 at Borden Forest, Ontario. These biophysical measurements were supported by on-site eddy covariance ﬂux measurements. Differences in the temporal development of LAI and ChlLeaf were considerable, with LAI reaching maximum values within approximately 10 days of bud burst at DOY 141. In contrast, ChlLeaf accumulation only reached maximum values at DOY 182. This divergence has important implications for GPP models which use LAI to represent the fraction of light absorbed by a canopy (fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (fAPAR)). Daily GPP values showed the strongest relationship with canopy chlorophyll content (ChlCanopy; R2 = 0.69, p {\textless} 0.001), with the LAI and GPP relationship displaying nonlinearity at the start and end of the growing season (R2 = 0.55, p {\textless} 0.001). Modeled GPP derived from LAI × PAR and ChlCanopy × PAR was tested against measured GPP, giving R2 = 0.63, p {\textless} 0.001 and R2 = 0.82, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively. This work demonstrates the importance of considering canopy pigment status in deciduous forests, with models that use fAPARLAI rather than fAPARChl neglecting to account for the importance of leaf photosynthetic potential.},

	abstract = {The role of tropical forests in sustainable development mechanisms and payments for environmental services is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, there is a greater need for accurate and detailed information about their biophysical characteristics (e.g., Leaf area index – LAI) along different stages of ecological succession. Remote sensing offers the possibility of providing relatively accurate estimations of such biophysical characteristics at a reasonable cost for most regional projects. The objectives of this study are to (1) document the variability of LAI in different stages of secondary growth in a tropical moist forest, (2) estimate LAI from spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), and (3) link LAI to the estimation of other canopy physiognomic characteristics. We found that segregation of LAI measurements by successional stage (early, intermediate, late) contributed to a better definition of the relationship between LAI and the SVIs. In addition, we conclude that the propagation of errors of precision through the SVI formulas must be taken into consideration along with intra-site and radiometric variability when uncertainty terms are calculated. From a linear regression analysis, we found that there is only a minimal difference between the nonparametric Theil – Sen and classical least-squares regressions. We also found that not only does the Lorentzian cumulative transition function describe the relationship between LAI and the SVIs, it also provides an estimate of the range of LAI values to which each index is sensitive.},

	abstract = {A constant ratio of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to solar radiation (SR) (about 0.45–0.46) has been used in many ecological studies to convert SR into PAR by multiplication. The constant ratio is useful and convenient. However, there is no general agreement on whether the ratio is 0.45 or 0.46 and how distributed globally. Accordingly, many local empirical ratios have been reported. This study aims to demonstrate a global distribution of the ratio and its changing range. Thus, we created two simple empirical models to estimate the ratio based on the in-situ climatic data to achieve the aim. The models were created based on accurate data of SR and PAR observed using a direct and diffuse separation method at Tateno in Tsukuba, Japan. At three validation sites in Japan, the ratio could be estimated with an error within 3\%, a considerable reduction from 15\% in using a constant. The numerical model also produced the ratio within approximately 3\% errors. Using the proposed model, we demonstrated that the annual mean of the ratio had a range from 0.409 to 0.477. The results will contribute to the uncertainty estimation when using a constant ratio.},

The 30-min data from 11 ﬂux tower locations in 5 vegetation types (desert grassland, temperate grasslands, crops, deciduous forests, and pine forest) were collected across the United States. Vegetation indices were derived using solar radiation and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured above the vegetation canopy throughout the year. The normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) estimated using the 30-min data was then used to quantify the LAI of the vegetation types at the various sites. The exponential function between LAI and NDVI indicated a non-linear relationship with the maximum tower-derived NDVI/LAI about 0.82/4.5 for corn, 0.85/6 for soybean, 0.6/2–0.8/4 for grasslands, and 0.81/7 for forest. Each vegetation type and environment exhibited unique seasonal and annual signatures of NDVI/LAI. The NDVI/LAI from the ﬂux towers compared well with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data derived at 1-km resolution and derived LAI showed excellent agreement with measurements in corn/soybean crops. These results encourage the use of real-time single point measurements of vegetation spectral indices in characterizing vegetation for routine plant-environment models.},

Information about the proximity of the reconstructed SIF (SIFr) datasets to GPP across land cover types and climatic conditions provides important support for a better application of these products for modelling applications. We conducted a multiscale analysis of four different long-term (12 years, 2007–2018) high-resolution global SIFr datasets (0.05◦ × 0.05◦), namely – CSIF (Contiguous SIF), GOSIF (Global OCO-2 SIF), LUE-SIF (Light Use Efficiency SIF), and HSIF (Harmonized SIF) - at 4-day, 8-day, and monthly time scales and found that for the majority of sites, the SIFr is linearly related to ground-based GPP measurements with the eddy covariance method. While the relationship between SIFr and GPP (i.e., the slope - GPP/SIFr) varied significantly across the SIFr datasets, sites, and land cover types, all four SIFr datasets were unequivocally a better predictor of GPP compared to remotely sensed vegetation indices – NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), sensed by the MODIS satellite. Furthermore, we also analyzed SIF-GPP relation­ ships during drought vs non-drought conditions and found that for about 30\% of the sites, comprising mostly non-forests site, the SIF-GPP relationship became weaker (decreased R2) with a lower slope during drought conditions compared to non-drought conditions. Among the four different products, the CSIF (at 4-day timescale) and GOSIF (at 8-day timescale) predicted GPP better compared to LUE-SIF and HSIF across all land cover types. Owing to their long-term availability (since 2000 for CSIF and GOSIF), these SIFr datasets combined with proxies of ecosystem properties can be used to appropriately capture vegetation dynamics and the interannual vari­ abilities across a wide range of climatic conditions.},

However, such consequences are difficult for decisionmakers to account for in environmental impact assessments. Solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) measured from satellite is strongly related to gross primary productivity of terrestrial vegetation and presents a new source of information from which to assess environmental impacts of land use decisions. We assess the usefulness of SIF measurements in accounting for changes in vegetation primary productivity due to land use change. We use a weighted double logistic regression based on the land cover mixture within SIF measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to separate the phenology of the SIF signal by land cover for the region of Ontario, Canada. We use SIF integrated annually to determine, in relative units, the consequences of land use change on photosynthetic carbon uptake for the study region. Finally, we map GPP at a spatial resolution of 30 m across the province of Ontario using previously reported relationships between SIF and GPP. We find that SIF tracks expected biogeographical patterns of productivity: urban areas exhibit an earlier start of the growing season, lower SIF magnitude and later end of season than natural land cover classes, whereas croplands exhibit a later start of season. Patterns of phenology and SIF magnitude show land cover transitions from Broadleaf Deciduous Forests to croplands or urban environments to have the highest impacts on carbon uptake. Satellite-based SIF mea­ surements are useful in exploring the geographic variation of vegetation productivity and can support inclusion of carbon accounting in environmental assessment at regional scale.},

	abstract = {Fog and low cloud cover (FLCC) provide critical moisture for ecosystems along the Pacific Coast during the summer months and it is currently unclear how climate change has affected FLCC occurrence. Additionally, FLCC impacts visibility and transportation safety for both road and air traffic. As such, a method for the monitoring of FLCC is necessary to inform land management decisions for fog-obligate species and to improve transportation safety, among other applications. Several gaps exist in current FLCC detection methodologies and while the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor has previously been used to detect fog, its utility has not been validated. In this study, we create a 20 year (2000–2020) FLCC dataset using the Terra MODIS cloud flags and examine its effectiveness in detecting daily and monthly FLCC presence along the California and southern Oregon coast for the summer months (June–September). We validate the accuracy of this method using an existing FLCC dataset derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) observations collected at 15 min intervals from 2000 to 2009. The two FLCC datasets have a strong linear relationship for FLCC frequency for each summer month, with an average r2 of 0.82 and p-value of {\textless}0.01. This strong relationship demonstrates the ability of Terra MODIS to reliably and accurately detect FLCC. Finally, we demonstrate a case study application of our FLCC dataset in a time series analysis over five coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) state parks in the Big Sur region of coastal California. This case study highlights the benefits provided by a 1 km resolution FLCC dataset for ecological applications and for monitoring spatiotemporal FLCC patterns across summer months over two decades. Our case study results showed that the number of foggy days fluctuates considerably year-to-year with no discernible positive or negative trend occurring between 2000 and 2020. Finally, we present a freely-accessible Google Earth Engine application to view and download the monthly FLCC data for all summer months for the years 2000–2020. The methods and dataset presented in this paper provide a means for efficient, daily FLCC monitoring at 1 km2 resolution, as well as the capacity for historical FLCC analyses.},

	abstract = {Abstract. With the eddy covariance (EC) technique, net fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other trace gases as well as water and energy fluxes can be measured at the ecosystem level. These flux measurements are a main source for understanding biosphere–atmosphere interactions and feedbacks through cross-site analysis, model–data integration, and upscaling. The raw fluxes measured with the EC technique require extensive and laborious data processing. While there are standard tools1 available in an open-source environment for processing high-frequency (10 or 20 Hz) data into half-hourly quality-checked fluxes, there is a need for more usable and extensible tools for the subsequent post-processing steps. We tackled this need by developing the REddyProc package in the cross-platform language R that provides standard CO2-focused post-processing routines for reading (half-)hourly data from different formats, estimating the u* threshold, as well as gap-filling, flux-partitioning, and visualizing the results. In addition to basic processing, the functions are extensible and allow easier integration in extended analysis than current tools. New features include cross-year processing and a better treatment of uncertainties. A comparison of REddyProc routines with other state-of-the-art tools resulted in no significant differences in monthly and annual fluxes across sites. Lower uncertainty estimates of both u* and resulting gap-filled fluxes by 50 \% with the presented tool were achieved by an improved treatment of seasons during the bootstrap analysis. Higher estimates of uncertainty in daytime partitioning (about twice as high) resulted from a better accounting for the uncertainty in estimates of temperature sensitivity of respiration. The provided routines can be easily installed, configured, and used. Hence, the eddy covariance community will benefit from the REddyProc package, allowing easier integration of standard post-processing with extended analysis. 1http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/2017/10/10/toolbox-a-rolling-list-of-softwarepackages-for-flux-related-data-processing/, last access: 17 August 2018},

	abstract = {Abstract. Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the sum of leaf photosynthesis and represents a crucial component of the global carbon cycle. Space-borne estimates of GPP typically rely on observable quantities that co-vary with GPP such as vegetation indices using reflectance measurements (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation, NIRv, and kernel normalized difference vegetation index, kNDVI). Recent work has also utilized measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) as a proxy for GPP. However, these SIF measurements are typically coarse resolution, while many processes influencing GPP occur at fine spatial scales. Here, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN), named SIFnet, that increases the resolution of SIF from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board of the satellite Sentinel-5P by a factor of 10 to a spatial resolution of 500 m. SIFnet utilizes coarse SIF observations together with high-resolution auxiliary data. The auxiliary data used here may carry information related to GPP and SIF. We use training data from non-US regions between April 2018 until March 2021 and evaluate our CNN over the conterminous United States (CONUS). We show that SIFnet is able to increase the resolution of TROPOMI SIF by a factor of 10 with a r2 and RMSE metrics of 0.92 and 0.17 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1, respectively. We further compare SIFnet against a recently developed downscaling approach and evaluate both methods against independent SIF measurements from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 and 3 (together OCO-2/3). SIFnet performs systematically better than the downscaling approach (r=0.78 for SIFnet, r=0.72 for downscaling), indicating that it is picking up on key features related to SIF and GPP. Examination of the feature importance in the neural network indicates a few key parameters and the spatial regions in which these parameters matter. Namely, the CNN finds low-resolution SIF data to be the most significant parameter with the NIRv vegetation index as the second most important parameter. NIRv consistently outperforms the recently proposed kNDVI vegetation index. Advantages and limitations of SIFnet are investigated and presented through a series of case studies across the United States. SIFnet represents a robust method to infer continuous, high-spatial-resolution SIF data.},

Such legacy effects of drought on vegetation growth and state have been widely studied in tree ring records and satellite-based vegetation greenness, while legacies on ecosystem carbon fluxes are still poorly quantified and understood. Here, we focus on two ecosystem monitoring sites in central Germany with a similar climate but characterised by different species and age structures. Using eddy covariance measurements, we detect legacies on gross primary productivity (GPP) by calculating the difference between random forest model estimates of potential GPP and observed GPP. Our results showed that, at both sites, droughts caused significant legacy
effects on GPP at seasonal and annual timescales, which were partly explained by reduced leaf development. The GPP reduction due to drought
legacy effects is of comparable magnitude to the concurrent drought effects but differed between two neighbouring forests with divergent species and age structures. The methodology proposed here allows the quantification of the temporal dynamics of legacy effects at the sub-seasonal scale and the separation of legacy effects from model uncertainties. The application of the methodology at a larger range of sites will help us to quantify whether the identified lag effects are general and on which factors they may depend.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Sun-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from satellites has shown potential as a remote sensing proxy for gross primary productivity (GPP). However, to fully exploit the potential of this signal, the robustness and stability of the SIF–GPP relationship across vegetation types and climates must be assessed. For this purpose, current studies have been limited by the availability of SIF datasets with sufficient spatial resolution to disentangle the signal between different vegetation cover types.
To overcome this limitation, this analysis uses GOME-2 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2) SIF retrievals, downscaled to a resolution of 0.05∘ (∼5 km)
to explore the relationship between SIF and FLUXCOM GPP (GPPFX), a data-driven dataset of primary productivity obtained by upscaling flux-tower measurements.
The high resolution of the downscaled SIF (SIFDS) dataset allows the relationships to be broken down by vegetation cover for separate climate zones, thus enabling a confrontation between GPP and SIF at fine granularity.
This analysis first investigates the spatial and temporal relationships between FLUXCOM GPP and downscaled SIF at a global scale.
A reasonably strong linear relationship is generally observed between SIFDS and GPPFX in all vegetation categories, and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) shows that the spatial response is similar between certain plant traits, with some distinction between herbaceous and woody vegetation and notable exceptions, such as equatorial broadleaf forests.
Geographical regions of non-linearity suggest where SIFDS could potentially provide information about ecosystem dynamics that are not represented in the FLUXCOM GPP dataset.
With the demonstration of downscaled SIF as a proxy for GPP, the response of SIFDS to short-term fluctuations in several meteorological variables is analysed and the most significant short-term environmental driving and limiting meteorological variables determined. Vegetation groupings of similar SIF–meteorological response reinforce the vegetation categorisations suggested by the ANCOVA.
This comparative exploration of two of the most recent products in carbon productivity estimation shows the value in downscaling SIF data, provides an independent probe of the FLUXCOM GPP model, enhances our understanding of the global SIF–GPP spatio-temporal relationship with a particular focus on the role of vegetation cover, and explores the similarity of the SIF and GPP responses to meteorological fluctuations.
Additional analyses with alternative SIF and GPP datasets support these conclusions.},

            Most biological rates depend on the rate of respiration. Temperature variation is typically considered the main driver of daily plant respiration rates, assuming a constant daily respiration rate at a set temperature. Here, we show empirical data from 31 species from temperate and tropical biomes to demonstrate that the rate of plant respiration at a constant temperature decreases monotonically with time through the night, on average by 25\% after 8 h of darkness. Temperature controls less than half of the total nocturnal variation in respiration. A new universal formulation is developed to model and understand nocturnal plant respiration, combining the nocturnal decrease in the rate of plant respiration at constant temperature with the decrease in plant respiration according to the temperature sensitivity. Application of the new formulation shows a global reduction of 4.5 −6 \% in plant respiration and an increase of 7-10\% in net primary production for the present-day.},

It relies on much higher data requirements than traditional forestry. These data requirements can be met by new devices that support continuous, in situ monitoring of forest conditions in real time. We propose a comprehensive network of sensors, i.e., a wireless sensor network (WSN), that can be part of a worldwide network of interconnected uniquely addressable objects, an Internet of Things (IoT), which can make data available in near real time to multiple stakeholders, including scientists, foresters, and forest managers, and may partially motivate citizens to participate in big data collection. The use of in situ sources of monitoring data as ground-truthed training data for remotely sensed data can boost forest monitoring by increasing the spatial and temporal scales of the monitoring, leading to a better understanding of forest processes and potential threats. Here, some of the key developments and applications of these sensors are outlined, together with guidelines for data management. Examples are given of their deployment to detect early warning signals (EWS) of ecosystem regime shifts in terms of forest productivity, health, and biodiversity. Analysis of the strategic use of these tools highlights the opportunities for engaging citizens and forest managers in this new generation of forest monitoring.},

Additionally, a modification of the criterion based on the APD is proposed and added to the comparison. A daily set of 101 bimodal annual cycle rain gauge stations in Central America from 1968 to 2012 is used. We found that the APD-based methodology detects false onsets and lengthens the demise of the rainy season.

	abstract = {Elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2) influences the carbon assimilation rate and stomatal conductance of plants, thereby affecting the global cycles of carbon and water. Yet, the detection of these physiological effects of eCO2 in observational data remains challenging, because natural variations and confounding factors (e.g., warming) can overshadow the eCO2 effects in observational data of real-­world ecosystems. In this study, we aim at developing a method to detect the emergence of the physiological CO2 effects on various variables related to carbon and water fluxes. We mimic the observational setting in ecosystems using a comprehensive process-­based land surface model QUINCY to simulate the leaf-l­evel effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and their century-­long propagation through the terrestrial carbon and water cycles across different climate regimes and biomes. We then develop a statistical method based on the signal-­to-­noise ratio to detect the emergence of the eCO2 effects. The eCO2 effect on gross primary productivity (GPP) emerges at relatively low CO2 increase (∆[CO2] {\textasciitilde} 20 ppm) where the leaf area index is relatively high. Compared to GPP, the eCO2 effect causing reduced transpiration water flux (normalized to leaf area) emerges only at relatively high CO2 increase (∆[CO2] {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 40 ppm), due to the high sensitivity to climate variability and thus lower signal-­to-­noise ratio. In general, the response to eCO2 is detectable earlier for variables related to the carbon cycle than the water cycle, when plant productivity is not limited by climatic constraints, and stronger in forest-­dominated rather than in grass-­dominated ecosystems. Our results provide a step toward when and where we expect to detect physiological CO2 effects in in-­situ flux measurements, how to detect them and encourage future efforts to improve the understanding and quantification of these effects in observations of terrestrial carbon and water dynamics.},

This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

Remotely sensed time series are not only non-stationary and unequally spaced (irregularly sampled) but also noisy due to atmospheric effects, such as clouds, haze, and smoke. To address this challenge, a robust method of jump detection is proposed based on the Anti-Leakage Least-Squares Spectral Analysis (ALLSSA) along with an appropriate temporal segmentation. This method, namely, Jumps Upon Spectrum and Trend (JUST), can simultaneously search for trends and statistically signiﬁcant spectral components of each time series segment to identify the potential jumps by considering appropriate weights associated with the time series. JUST is successfully applied to simulated vegetation time series with varying jump location and magnitude, the number of observations, seasonal component, and noises. Using a collection of simulated and real-world vegetation time series in southeastern Australia, it is shown that JUST performs better than Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) in identifying jumps within the trend component of time series with various types. Furthermore, JUST is applied to Landsat 8 composites for a forested region in California, U.S., to show its potential in characterizing spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. Therefore, JUST is recommended as a robust and alternative change detection method which can consider the observational uncertainties and does not require any interpolations and/or gap ﬁllings.},

	abstract = {The development of analytical software for big Earth observation data faces several challenges. Designers need to balance between conﬂicting factors. Solutions that are efﬁcient for speciﬁc hardware architectures can not be used in other environments. Packages that work on generic hardware and open standards will not have the same performance as dedicated solutions. Software that assumes that its users are computer programmers are ﬂexible but may be difﬁcult to learn for a wide audience. This paper describes sits, an open-source R package for satellite image time series analysis using machine learning. To allow experts to use satellite imagery to the fullest extent, sits adopts a time-ﬁrst, space-later approach. It supports the complete cycle of data analysis for land classiﬁcation. Its API provides a simple but powerful set of functions. The software works in different cloud computing environments. Satellite image time series are input to machine learning classiﬁers, and the results are post-processed using spatial smoothing. Since machine learning methods need accurate training data, sits includes methods for quality assessment of training samples. The software also provides methods for validation and accuracy measurement. The package thus comprises a production environment for big EO data analysis. We show that this approach produces high accuracy for land use and land cover maps through a case study in the Cerrado biome, one of the world’s fast moving agricultural frontiers for the year 2018.},

Here, we present the application of deep learning time series separation of leaves and wood from TLS point clouds collected from broad-leaved trees. First, we use a multiple radius nearest neighbor approach to obtain a time series of the geometric features. Second, we compare the performance of Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN), Long Short-Term Memory Fully Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM-FCN), and Residual Network (ResNet) on leaf and wood classiﬁcation. We also compare the effect of univariable (UTS) and multivariable (MTS) time series on classiﬁcation accuracy. Finally, we explore the utilization of a class activation map (CAM) to reduce the black-box effect of deep learning. The average overall accuracy of the MTS method across the training data is 0.96, which is higher than the UTS methods (0.67 to 0.88). Meanwhile, ResNet spent much more time than FCN and LSTM-FCN in model development. When testing our method on an independent dataset, the MTS models based on FCN, LSTM-FCN, and ResNet all demonstrate similar performance. Our method indicates that the CAM can explain the black-box effect of deep learning and suggests that deep learning algorithms coupled with geometric feature time series can accurately separate leaf and woody components from point clouds. This provides a good starting point for future research into estimation of forest structure parameters.},

            Assessing the seasonal patterns of the Amazon rainforests has been difficult because of the paucity of ground observations and persistent cloud cover over these forests obscuring optical remote sensing observations. Here, we use data from a new generation of geostationary satellites that carry the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) to study the Amazon canopy. ABI is similar to the widely used polar orbiting sensor, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), but provides observations every 10–15 min. Our analysis of NDVI data collected over the Amazon during 2018–19 shows that ABI provides 21–35 times more cloud-free observations in a month than MODIS. The analyses show statistically significant changes in seasonality over 85\% of Amazon forest pixels, an area about three times greater than previously reported using MODIS data. Though additional work is needed in converting the observed changes in seasonality into meaningful changes in canopy dynamics, our results highlight the potential of the new generation geostationary satellites to help us better understand tropical ecosystems, which has been a challenge with only polar orbiting satellites.},

            Vegetation phenology is a key control on water, energy, and carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. Because vegetation canopies are heterogeneous, spatially explicit information related to seasonality in vegetation activity provides valuable information for studies that use eddy covariance measurements to study ecosystem function and land-atmosphere interactions. Here we present a land surface phenology (LSP) dataset derived at 3 m spatial resolution from PlanetScope imagery across a range of plant functional types and climates in North America. The dataset provides spatially explicit information related to the timing of phenophase changes such as the start, peak, and end of vegetation activity, along with vegetation index metrics and associated quality assurance flags for the growing seasons of 2017–2021 for 10 × 10 km windows centred over 104 eddy covariance towers at AmeriFlux and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites. These LSP data can be used to analyse processes controlling the seasonality of ecosystem-scale carbon, water, and energy fluxes, to evaluate predictions from land surface models, and to assess satellite-based LSP products.},

              Earth system models predict that increases in atmospheric and soil dryness will reduce photosynthesis in the Amazon rainforest, with large implications for the global carbon cycle. Using in situ observations, solar-induced fluorescence, and nonlinear machine learning techniques, we show that, in reality, this is not necessarily the case: In many of the wettest parts of this region, photosynthesis and biomass tend to increase with increased atmospheric dryness, despite the associated reductions in canopy conductance to CO
              2
              . These results can be largely explained by changes in canopy properties, specifically, new leaves flushed during the dry season have higher photosynthetic capacity than the leaves they replace, compensating for the negative stomatal response to increased dryness. As atmospheric dryness will increase with climate change, our study highlights the importance of reframing how we represent the response of ecosystem photosynthesis to atmospheric dryness in very wet regions, to accurately quantify the land carbon sink.},

              Empirical vegetation indices derived from spectral reflectance data are widely used in remote sensing of the biosphere, as they represent robust proxies for canopy structure, leaf pigment content, and, subsequently, plant photosynthetic potential. Here, we generalize the broad family of commonly used vegetation indices by exploiting all higher-order relations between the spectral channels involved. This results in a higher sensitivity to vegetation biophysical and physiological parameters. The presented nonlinear generalization of the celebrated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) consistently improves accuracy in monitoring key parameters, such as leaf area index, gross primary productivity, and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. Results suggest that the statistical approach maximally exploits the spectral information and addresses long-standing problems in satellite Earth Observation of the terrestrial biosphere.

In this review, I explore how carbon and water fluxes of the world's ecosystem are responding to a suite of covarying environmental factors, like sunlight, temperature, soil moisture, and carbon dioxide. I also report on how coupled carbon and water fluxes are modulated by biological and ecological factors such as phenology and a suite of structural and functional properties. And, I investigate whether long‐term trends in carbon and water fluxes are emerging in various ecological and climate spaces and the degree to which they may be driven by physical and biological forcings. As a growing number of time series extend up to 20 years in duration, we are at the verge of capturing ecosystem scale trends in the breathing of a changing biosphere. Consequently, flux measurements need to continue to report on future conditions and responses and assess the efficacy of natural climate solutions.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides a powerful proxy for gross primary productivity (GPP). It is particularly promising in boreal ecosystems where seasonal downregulation of photosynthesis occurs without significant changes in canopy structure or chlorophyll content. The use of SIF as a proxy for GPP is complicated by inherent non-linearities due to both physical (illumination effects) and ecophysiological (light use efficiencies) controls at fine spatial (tower/leaf) and temporal (halfhourly) scales. To study the SIF-GPP relationship, we investigated the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of continuous tower-based measurements of SIF, GPP, and common vegetation indices at the Southern Old Black Spruce Site (SOBS) in Saskatchewan, CA over the course of two years. We find that SIF outperforms other vegetation indices as a proxy for GPP at all temporal scales but shows a non-linear relationship with GPP at a half-hourly resolution. At small temporal scales, SIF and GPP are predominantly driven by light and non-linearity between SIF and GPP is due to the light saturation of GPP. Averaged over daily and monthly scales, the relationship between SIF and GPP is linear due to a reduction in the observed PAR range. Seasonal changes in the light responses of SIF and GPP are driven by changes in light use efficiency which co-vary with changes in temperature, while illumination and canopy structure partially linearize the SIF-GPP relationship. Additionally, we find that the SIF-GPP relationship has a seasonal dependency. Our results help clarify the utility of SIF for estimating carbon assimilation in boreal forests.},

Information about the proximity of the reconstructed SIF (SIFr) datasets to GPP across land cover types and climatic conditions provides important support for a better application of these products for modelling applications. We conducted a multiscale analysis of four different long-term (12 years, 2007–2018) high-resolution global SIFr datasets (0.05◦ × 0.05◦), namely – CSIF (Contiguous SIF), GOSIF (Global OCO-2 SIF), LUE-SIF (Light Use Efficiency SIF), and HSIF (Harmonized SIF) - at 4-day, 8-day, and monthly time scales and found that for the majority of sites, the SIFr is linearly related to ground-based GPP measurements with the eddy covariance method. While the relationship between SIFr and GPP (i.e., the slope - GPP/SIFr) varied significantly across the SIFr datasets, sites, and land cover types, all four SIFr datasets were unequivocally a better predictor of GPP compared to remotely sensed vegetation indices – NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), sensed by the MODIS satellite. Furthermore, we also analyzed SIF-GPP relation­ ships during drought vs non-drought conditions and found that for about 30\% of the sites, comprising mostly non-forests site, the SIF-GPP relationship became weaker (decreased R2) with a lower slope during drought conditions compared to non-drought conditions. Among the four different products, the CSIF (at 4-day timescale) and GOSIF (at 8-day timescale) predicted GPP better compared to LUE-SIF and HSIF across all land cover types. Owing to their long-term availability (since 2000 for CSIF and GOSIF), these SIFr datasets combined with proxies of ecosystem properties can be used to appropriately capture vegetation dynamics and the interannual vari­ abilities across a wide range of climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Time series of wetland methane fluxes measured by eddy covariance require gap-filling to estimate daily, sea­ sonal, and annual emissions. Gap-filling methane fluxes is challenging because of high variability and complex responses to multiple drivers. To date, there is no widely established gap-filling standard for wetland methane fluxes, with regards both to the best model algorithms and predictors. This study synthesizes results of different gap-filling methods systematically applied at 17 wetland sites spanning boreal to tropical regions and including all major wetland classes and two rice paddies. Procedures are proposed for: 1) creating realistic artificial gap scenarios, 2) training and evaluating gap-filling models without overstating performance, and 3) predicting halfhourly methane fluxes and annual emissions with realistic uncertainty estimates. Performance is compared be­ tween a conventional method (marginal distribution sampling) and four machine learning algorithms. The conventional method achieved similar median performance as the machine learning models but was worse than the best machine learning models and relatively insensitive to predictor choices. Of the machine learning models, decision tree algorithms performed the best in cross-validation experiments, even with a baseline predictor set, and artificial neural networks showed comparable performance when using all predictors. Soil temperature was frequently the most important predictor whilst water table depth was important at sites with substantial water table fluctuations, highlighting the value of data on wetland soil conditions. Raw gap-filling uncertainties from the machine learning models were underestimated and we propose a method to calibrate uncertainties to ob­ servations. The python code for model development, evaluation, and uncertainty estimation is publicly available. This study outlines a modular and robust machine learning workflow and makes recommendations for, and evaluates an improved baseline of, methane gap-filling models that can be implemented in multi-site syntheses or standardized products from regional and global flux networks (e.g., FLUXNET).},

	abstract = {A large sample of ground-based evapotranspiration (ET) measurements made in the United States, primarily from eddy covariance systems, were post-processed to produce a benchmark ET dataset. The dataset was produced primarily to support the intercomparison and evaluation of the OpenET satellite-based remote sensing ET (RSET) models and could also be used to evaluate ET data from other models and approaches. OpenET is a web-based service that makes field-delineated and pixel-level ET estimates from well-established RSET models readily available to water managers, agricultural producers, and the public. The benchmark dataset is composed of flux and meteorological data from a variety of providers covering native vegetation and agricultural settings. Flux footprint predictions were developed for each station and included static flux footprints developed based on average wind direction and speed, as well as dynamic hourly footprints that were generated with a physically based model of upwind source area. The two footprint prediction methods were rigorously compared to evaluate their relative spatial coverage. Data from all sources were post-processed in a consistent and reproducible manner including data handling, gap-filling, temporal aggregation, and energy balance closure correction. The resulting dataset included 243,048 daily and 5,284 monthly ET values from 194 stations, with all data falling between 1995 and 2021. We assessed average daily energy imbalance using 172 flux sites with a total of 193,021 days of data, finding that overall turbulent fluxes were understated by about 12\% on average relative to available energy. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that daily average latent energy flux may be typically understated slightly more than sensible heat flux. This dataset was developed to provide a consistent reference to support evaluation of RSET data being developed for a wide range of applications related to water accounting and water resources management at field to watershed scales.},

A framework combining method to estimate instantaneous FAPAR (instantaneous FAPAR method) and method to calculate daily FAPAR (instantaneous-to-daily FAPAR method) was proposed. Instantaneous FAPAR method for estimating intra-daily FAPAR from reduced observations was evaluated. Three instantaneous-to-daily FAPAR methods (ratio, simple average and solar zenith angle weighted average methods) were compared to estimate the daily FAPAR from continuous instantaneous values. The daily FAPAR was finally estimated from MODIS instantaneous values. The estimation and validation were performed at seven forest sites distributed in North America and Western Europe.},

	abstract = {Land use decisions directly affect the terrestrial carbon balance by changing the quantity and type of vegetation present. However, such consequences are difficult for decisionmakers to account for in environmental impact assessments. Solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) measured from satellite is strongly related to gross primary productivity of terrestrial vegetation and presents a new source of information from which to assess environmental impacts of land use decisions. We assess the usefulness of SIF measurements in accounting for changes in vegetation primary productivity due to land use change. We use a weighted double logistic regression based on the land cover mixture within SIF measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to separate the phenology of the SIF signal by land cover for the region of Ontario, Canada. We use SIF integrated annually to determine, in relative units, the consequences of land use change on photosynthetic carbon uptake for the study region. Finally, we map GPP at a spatial resolution of 30 m across the province of Ontario using previously reported relationships between SIF and GPP. We find that SIF tracks expected biogeographical patterns of productivity: urban areas exhibit an earlier start of the growing season, lower SIF magnitude and later end of season than natural land cover classes, whereas croplands exhibit a later start of season. Patterns of phenology and SIF magnitude show land cover transitions from Broadleaf Deciduous Forests to croplands or urban environments to have the highest impacts on carbon uptake. Satellite-based SIF mea­ surements are useful in exploring the geographic variation of vegetation productivity and can support inclusion of carbon accounting in environmental assessment at regional scale.},

The ground measurements of Net Ecosystem Ex­ change (NEE) and respiration (RESP) were conducted at 26 sites at the peatland using chamber method during the vegetation growth from April to October 2015–2020. Applying round-theclock registrations of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and one ground measurement of NEE and RESP the simulation of the daily course of GPP was performed. GPP daily mean values were the object of estimation applying the models based on the satellite data derived from Sentinel 2, Sentinel 3 and MODIS. The main factors of photosynthetic carbon uptake – greenness and moisture were described by satellite vegetation indices Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), Accumulated Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR), evapotranspiration, latent heat and the differences of surface temper­ ature (Ts) and air temperature (Ta). The models presented as a result of this research can be used applying solely the satellite data. The results of the analysis revealed that NDVI index is the driving factor for the assessment of GPP independently on the type of satellite data (r = 0.64) Up to 40\% of GPP variance is explained by the variable connected with the vegetation greenness. The contribution of vegetation moisture indices is about two times smaller. The best fit has been achieved for the Sentinel-3 models with inclusion of the environmental parameters, as NDVI, temperature difference (Ts–Ta), latent heat. The differences of uptake the CO2 between the habitats depending on their phases of phenological development have been presented.},

	abstract = {Fog and low cloud cover (FLCC) provide critical moisture for ecosystems along the Pacific Coast during the summer months and it is currently unclear how climate change has affected FLCC occurrence. Additionally, FLCC impacts visibility and transportation safety for both road and air traffic. As such, a method for the monitoring of FLCC is necessary to inform land management decisions for fog-obligate species and to improve transportation safety, among other applications. Several gaps exist in current FLCC detection methodologies and while the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor has previously been used to detect fog, its utility has not been validated. In this study, we create a 20 year (2000–2020) FLCC dataset using the Terra MODIS cloud flags and examine its effectiveness in detecting daily and monthly FLCC presence along the California and southern Oregon coast for the summer months (June–September). We validate the accuracy of this method using an existing FLCC dataset derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) observations collected at 15 min intervals from 2000 to 2009. The two FLCC datasets have a strong linear relationship for FLCC frequency for each summer month, with an average r2 of 0.82 and p-value of {\textless}0.01. This strong relationship demonstrates the ability of Terra MODIS to reliably and accurately detect FLCC. Finally, we demonstrate a case study application of our FLCC dataset in a time series analysis over five coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) state parks in the Big Sur region of coastal California. This case study highlights the benefits provided by a 1 km resolution FLCC dataset for ecological applications and for monitoring spatiotemporal FLCC patterns across summer months over two decades. Our case study results showed that the number of foggy days fluctuates considerably year-to-year with no discernible positive or negative trend occurring between 2000 and 2020. Finally, we present a freely-accessible Google Earth Engine application to view and download the monthly FLCC data for all summer months for the years 2000–2020. The methods and dataset presented in this paper provide a means for efficient, daily FLCC monitoring at 1 km2 resolution, as well as the capacity for historical FLCC analyses.},

Currently, several global datasets of vegetation production are available at coarse or moderate spatial resolutions, but globally they still have large uncertainties, which hindered the application of GPP, especially in strongly heterogeneous agriculture ecosys­ tems and mountainous areas. Here, we used the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach with the footprints of FLUXNET data to optimize the parameters of the high resolution of Global LAnd Surface Satellite (Hi-GLASS) GPP algorithm (i.e., the revised EC-LUE model) using 30 m spatial resolution Landsat data as driving data. Then, we generated a new set of algorithm parameters for high resolution GPP estimates. We used the optimized parameters with integrating footprint to calculate Hi-GLASS GPP based on Landsat data and our results revealed that on average, Hi-GLASS GPP explained 76\% of variance in tower GPP at the total of 78 sites across ten vegetation types. Moreover, compared with previous 500 m GPP product such as GLASS GPP and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP, our optimized Hi-GLASS algorithm using Landsat data had large superiority in simulating GPP for wetlands, savannas, shrubland and C3, C4 cropland ecosystems, and had a slightly improvement for deciduous broadleaf forests and evergreen broadleaf forest ecosystem. Our study is an effort to optimize and quantify parameter uncertainty of Hi-GLASS algorithm using high spatial resolution (30 m) Landsat data and improve the high resolution GPP estimation for better understanding global ecosystem carbon dynamics and carbon-climate feedbacks.},

	abstract = {Savannas cover a wide climatic gradient across large portions of the Earth’s land surface and are an important component of the terrestrial biosphere. Savannas have been undergoing changes that alter the composition and structure of their vegetation such as the encroachment of woody vegetation and increasing land-use intensity. Monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of savanna ecosystem structure (e.g., partitioning woody and herbaceous vegetation) and function (e.g., aboveground biomass) is of high importance. Major challenges include misclassification of savannas as forests at the mesic end of their range, disentangling the contribution of woody and herbaceous vegetation to aboveground biomass, and quantifying and mapping fuel loads. Here, we review current (2010–present) research in the application of satellite remote sensing in savannas at regional and global scales. We identify emerging opportunities in satellite remote sensing that can help overcome existing challenges. We provide recommendations on how these opportunities can be leveraged, specifically (1) the development of a conceptual framework that leads to a consistent definition of savannas in remote sensing; (2) improving mapping of savannas to include ecologically relevant information such as soil properties and fire activity; (3) exploiting high-resolution imagery provided by nanosatellites to better understand the role of landscape structure in ecosystem functioning; and (4) using novel approaches from artificial intelligence and machine learning in combination with multisource satellite observations, e.g., multi-/hyperspectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and light detection and ranging (lidar), and data on plant traits to infer potentially new relationships between biotic and abiotic components of savannas that can be either proven or disproven with targeted field experiments.},

              Empirical vegetation indices derived from spectral reflectance data are widely used in remote sensing of the biosphere, as they represent robust proxies for canopy structure, leaf pigment content, and, subsequently, plant photosynthetic potential. Here, we generalize the broad family of commonly used vegetation indices by exploiting all higher-order relations between the spectral channels involved. This results in a higher sensitivity to vegetation biophysical and physiological parameters. The presented nonlinear generalization of the celebrated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) consistently improves accuracy in monitoring key parameters, such as leaf area index, gross primary productivity, and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. Results suggest that the statistical approach maximally exploits the spectral information and addresses long-standing problems in satellite Earth Observation of the terrestrial biosphere.

	abstract = {Abstract. With the eddy covariance (EC) technique, net fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other trace gases as well as water and energy fluxes can be measured at the ecosystem level. These flux measurements are a main source for understanding biosphere–atmosphere interactions and feedbacks through cross-site analysis, model–data integration, and upscaling. The raw fluxes measured with the EC technique require extensive and laborious data processing. While there are standard tools1 available in an open-source environment for processing high-frequency (10 or 20 Hz) data into half-hourly quality-checked fluxes, there is a need for more usable and extensible tools for the subsequent post-processing steps. We tackled this need by developing the REddyProc package in the cross-platform language R that provides standard CO2-focused post-processing routines for reading (half-)hourly data from different formats, estimating the u* threshold, as well as gap-filling, flux-partitioning, and visualizing the results. In addition to basic processing, the functions are extensible and allow easier integration in extended analysis than current tools. New features include cross-year processing and a better treatment of uncertainties. A comparison of REddyProc routines with other state-of-the-art tools resulted in no significant differences in monthly and annual fluxes across sites. Lower uncertainty estimates of both u* and resulting gap-filled fluxes by 50 \% with the presented tool were achieved by an improved treatment of seasons during the bootstrap analysis. Higher estimates of uncertainty in daytime partitioning (about twice as high) resulted from a better accounting for the uncertainty in estimates of temperature sensitivity of respiration. The provided routines can be easily installed, configured, and used. Hence, the eddy covariance community will benefit from the REddyProc package, allowing easier integration of standard post-processing with extended analysis. 1http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/2017/10/10/toolbox-a-rolling-list-of-softwarepackages-for-flux-related-data-processing/, last access: 17 August 2018},

	abstract = {Abstract. Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the sum of leaf photosynthesis and represents a crucial component of the global carbon cycle. Space-borne estimates of GPP typically rely on observable quantities that co-vary with GPP such as vegetation indices using reflectance measurements (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation, NIRv, and kernel normalized difference vegetation index, kNDVI). Recent work has also utilized measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) as a proxy for GPP. However, these SIF measurements are typically coarse resolution, while many processes influencing GPP occur at fine spatial scales. Here, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN), named SIFnet, that increases the resolution of SIF from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board of the satellite Sentinel-5P by a factor of 10 to a spatial resolution of 500 m. SIFnet utilizes coarse SIF observations together with high-resolution auxiliary data. The auxiliary data used here may carry information related to GPP and SIF. We use training data from non-US regions between April 2018 until March 2021 and evaluate our CNN over the conterminous United States (CONUS). We show that SIFnet is able to increase the resolution of TROPOMI SIF by a factor of 10 with a r2 and RMSE metrics of 0.92 and 0.17 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1, respectively. We further compare SIFnet against a recently developed downscaling approach and evaluate both methods against independent SIF measurements from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 and 3 (together OCO-2/3). SIFnet performs systematically better than the downscaling approach (r=0.78 for SIFnet, r=0.72 for downscaling), indicating that it is picking up on key features related to SIF and GPP. Examination of the feature importance in the neural network indicates a few key parameters and the spatial regions in which these parameters matter. Namely, the CNN finds low-resolution SIF data to be the most significant parameter with the NIRv vegetation index as the second most important parameter. NIRv consistently outperforms the recently proposed kNDVI vegetation index. Advantages and limitations of SIFnet are investigated and presented through a series of case studies across the United States. SIFnet represents a robust method to infer continuous, high-spatial-resolution SIF data.},

Such legacy effects of drought on vegetation growth and state have been widely studied in tree ring records and satellite-based vegetation greenness, while legacies on ecosystem carbon fluxes are still poorly quantified and understood. Here, we focus on two ecosystem monitoring sites in central Germany with a similar climate but characterised by different species and age structures. Using eddy covariance measurements, we detect legacies on gross primary productivity (GPP) by calculating the difference between random forest model estimates of potential GPP and observed GPP. Our results showed that, at both sites, droughts caused significant legacy effects on GPP at seasonal and annual timescales, which were partly explained by reduced leaf development. The GPP reduction due to drought legacy effects is of comparable magnitude to the concurrent drought effects but differed between two neighbouring forests with divergent species and age structures. The methodology proposed here allows the quantification of the temporal dynamics of legacy effects at the sub-seasonal scale and the separation of legacy effects from model uncertainties. The application of the methodology at a larger range of sites will help us to quantify whether the identified lag effects are general and on which factors they may depend.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Sun-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from satellites has shown potential as a remote sensing proxy for gross primary productivity (GPP). However, to fully exploit the potential of this signal, the robustness and stability of the SIF–GPP relationship across vegetation types and climates must be assessed. For this purpose, current studies have been limited by the availability of SIF datasets with sufficient spatial resolution to disentangle the signal between different vegetation cover types.
To overcome this limitation, this analysis uses GOME-2 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2) SIF retrievals, downscaled to a resolution of 0.05∘ (∼5 km)
to explore the relationship between SIF and FLUXCOM GPP (GPPFX), a data-driven dataset of primary productivity obtained by upscaling flux-tower measurements.
The high resolution of the downscaled SIF (SIFDS) dataset allows the relationships to be broken down by vegetation cover for separate climate zones, thus enabling a confrontation between GPP and SIF at fine granularity.
This analysis first investigates the spatial and temporal relationships between FLUXCOM GPP and downscaled SIF at a global scale.
A reasonably strong linear relationship is generally observed between SIFDS and GPPFX in all vegetation categories, and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) shows that the spatial response is similar between certain plant traits, with some distinction between herbaceous and woody vegetation and notable exceptions, such as equatorial broadleaf forests.
Geographical regions of non-linearity suggest where SIFDS could potentially provide information about ecosystem dynamics that are not represented in the FLUXCOM GPP dataset.
With the demonstration of downscaled SIF as a proxy for GPP, the response of SIFDS to short-term fluctuations in several meteorological variables is analysed and the most significant short-term environmental driving and limiting meteorological variables determined. Vegetation groupings of similar SIF–meteorological response reinforce the vegetation categorisations suggested by the ANCOVA.
This comparative exploration of two of the most recent products in carbon productivity estimation shows the value in downscaling SIF data, provides an independent probe of the FLUXCOM GPP model, enhances our understanding of the global SIF–GPP spatio-temporal relationship with a particular focus on the role of vegetation cover, and explores the similarity of the SIF and GPP responses to meteorological fluctuations.
Additional analyses with alternative SIF and GPP datasets support these conclusions.},

            Most biological rates depend on the rate of respiration. Temperature variation is typically considered the main driver of daily plant respiration rates, assuming a constant daily respiration rate at a set temperature. Here, we show empirical data from 31 species from temperate and tropical biomes to demonstrate that the rate of plant respiration at a constant temperature decreases monotonically with time through the night, on average by 25\% after 8 h of darkness. Temperature controls less than half of the total nocturnal variation in respiration. A new universal formulation is developed to model and understand nocturnal plant respiration, combining the nocturnal decrease in the rate of plant respiration at constant temperature with the decrease in plant respiration according to the temperature sensitivity. Application of the new formulation shows a global reduction of 4.5 −6 \% in plant respiration and an increase of 7-10\% in net primary production for the present-day.},

It relies on much higher data requirements than traditional forestry. These data requirements can be met by new devices that support continuous, in situ monitoring of forest conditions in real time. We propose a comprehensive network of sensors, i.e., a wireless sensor network (WSN), that can be part of a worldwide network of interconnected uniquely addressable objects, an Internet of Things (IoT), which can make data available in near real time to multiple stakeholders, including scientists, foresters, and forest managers, and may partially motivate citizens to participate in big data collection. The use of in situ sources of monitoring data as ground-truthed training data for remotely sensed data can boost forest monitoring by increasing the spatial and temporal scales of the monitoring, leading to a better understanding of forest processes and potential threats. Here, some of the key developments and applications of these sensors are outlined, together with guidelines for data management. Examples are given of their deployment to detect early warning signals (EWS) of ecosystem regime shifts in terms of forest productivity, health, and biodiversity. Analysis of the strategic use of these tools highlights the opportunities for engaging citizens and forest managers in this new generation of forest monitoring.},

Additionally, a modification of the criterion based on the APD is proposed and added to the comparison. A daily set of 101 bimodal annual cycle rain gauge stations in Central America from 1968 to 2012 is used. We found that the APD-based methodology detects false onsets and lengthens the demise of the rainy season.

We use 5 m resolution RapidEye optical data to support a country wide biomass inventory with the objective of bringing to the attention of the traditional forestry sector the advantages of integrating remote sensing data in the planning and execution of ﬁeld data acquisition. We analysed the relationship between AGB estimates from a subset of the national survey ﬁeld plot data collected by the Tanzania Forest Service, with a set of remote sensing biophysical parameters extracted from a sample of ﬁne spatial (5 m) resolution RapidEye images using a regression estimator. We processed RapidEye data using image segmentation for 76 sample sites each of 20 km by 20 km (covering 2.3\% of the land area of the country) to image objects of 1 ha. We extracted reﬂectance and texture information from those objects which overlapped with the ﬁeld plot data and tested correlations between the two using four different models: Two models from inferential statistics and two models from machine learning. The best results were found using the random forests algorithm (R2 = 0.69). The most important explicative factor extracted from the remote sensing data was the shadow index, measuring the absorption of light in the visible bands. The model was then applied to all image objects on the RapidEye images to obtain AGB for each of the 76 sample sites, which were then interpolated to estimate the AGB stock at the national scale. Using the relative efﬁciency measure, we assessed the improvement that the introduction of remote sensing data brings to obtain an AGB estimate at the national level, with the same precision as the full survey. The improvement in the precision of the estimate (by reducing its variance) resulted in a relative efﬁciency of 3.2. This demonstrates that the introduction of remote sensing data at this ﬁne resolution can substantially reduce the number of ﬁeld plots required, in this case threefold.},

In this review, I explore how carbon and water fluxes of the world's ecosystem are responding to a suite of covarying environmental factors, like sunlight, temperature, soil moisture, and carbon dioxide. I also report on how coupled carbon and water fluxes are modulated by biological and ecological factors such as phenology and a suite of structural and functional properties. And, I investigate whether long‐term trends in carbon and water fluxes are emerging in various ecological and climate spaces and the degree to which they may be driven by physical and biological forcings. As a growing number of time series extend up to 20 years in duration, we are at the verge of capturing ecosystem scale trends in the breathing of a changing biosphere. Consequently, flux measurements need to continue to report on future conditions and responses and assess the efficacy of natural climate solutions.},

Yet, the detection of these physiological effects of eCO2 in observational data remains challenging, because natural variations and confounding factors (e.g., warming) can overshadow the eCO2 effects in observational data of real-­world ecosystems. In this study, we aim at developing a method to detect the emergence of the physiological CO2 effects on various variables related to carbon and water fluxes. We mimic the observational setting in ecosystems using a comprehensive process-­based land surface model QUINCY to simulate the leaf-l­evel effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and their century-­long propagation through the terrestrial carbon and water cycles across different climate regimes and biomes. We then develop a statistical method based on the signal-­to-­noise ratio to detect the emergence of the eCO2 effects. The eCO2 effect on gross primary productivity (GPP) emerges at relatively low CO2 increase (∆[CO2] {\textasciitilde} 20 ppm) where the leaf area index is relatively high. Compared to GPP, the eCO2 effect causing reduced transpiration water flux (normalized to leaf area) emerges only at relatively high CO2 increase (∆[CO2] {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 40 ppm), due to the high sensitivity to climate variability and thus lower signal-­to-­noise ratio. In general, the response to eCO2 is detectable earlier for variables related to the carbon cycle than the water cycle, when plant productivity is not limited by climatic constraints, and stronger in forest-­dominated rather than in grass-­dominated ecosystems. Our results provide a step toward when and where we expect to detect physiological CO2 effects in in-­situ flux measurements, how to detect them and encourage future efforts to improve the understanding and quantification of these effects in observations of terrestrial carbon and water dynamics.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric reanalyses combine observations and models through data assimilation techniques to provide spatio-temporally continuous fields of key surface variables. They can do so for extended historical periods whilst ensuring a coherent representation of the main Earth system cycles. ERA5, and its enhanced land surface component ERA5-Land, are widely used in Earth 5 System science and form the flagship products of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission. Such land surface modelling frameworks generally rely on a state variable called leaf area index (LAI), representing the amount of leaves in a grid cell at a given time, to quantify the fluxes of carbon, water and energy between the vegetation and the atmosphere. However, the LAI within the modelling framework behind ERA5 and ERA5-Land is prescribed as a climatological seasonal cycle, neglecting any inter-annual variability and the potential consequences that this uncoupling between 10 vegetation and atmosphere may have on the surface energy balance and the climate. To evaluate the impact of this mismatch in LAI, we analyse the corresponding effect it has on land surface temperature (LST) by comparing what is simulated to satellite observations. We characterise a hysteretic behaviour between LST biases and LAI biases that evolves differently along the year depending on the background climate. We further analyse their repercussion on the reconstructed climate during the more extreme conditions in terms of LAI deviations, with a specific focus on the 2003, 2010 and 2018 heatwaves in Europe where 15 LST mismatches are exacerbated. We anticipate that our results will assist users of ERA5 and ERA5-Land data to understand where and when the larger discrepancies can be expected, but also guide developers towards improving the modelling framework. Finally, this study could provide a blueprint for a wider benchmarking framework for land surface model evaluation that exploits the capacity of LST to integrate the effects of both radiative and non-radiative processes affecting the surface energy.},

Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

	abstract = {Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the most important component of terrestrial carbon flux. Red-edge (680–780 nm) reflectance is sensitive to leaf chlorophyll content, which is directly correlated with photosynthesis as the pigment pool, and it has the potential to improve GPP estimation. The European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2A and B satellites provide red-edge bands at 20-m spatial resolution on a five-day revisit period, which can be used for global estimation of GPP. Previous studies focused mostly on improving cropland GPP estimation using red-edge bands. In this study, we firstly evaluated the relationship between eight vegetation indices (VIs) retrieved from Sentinel-2 imagery in association with incident photosynthetic active radiation (PARin) and carbon flux tower GPP (GPPEC) across three forest and two grassland sites in Australia. We derived a time series of five red-edge VIs and three non-red-edge VIs over the CO2 flux tower footprints at 16-day time intervals and compared both temporal and spatial variations. The results showed that the relationship between the red-edge index (CIr,       ρ 783   ρ 705   − 1    ) multiplied by PARin and GPPEC had the highest correlation (R2 = 0.77, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.81 gC∙m−2∙day−1) at the two grassland sites. The CIr also showed consistency (rRMSE defined as RMSE/mean GPP, lower than 0.25) across forest and grassland sites. The high spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data provided more detailed information to adequately characterize the GPP variance at spatially heterogeneous areas. The high revisit period of Sentinel-2 exhibited temporal variance in GPP at the grassland sites; however, at forest sites, the flux-tower-based GPP variance could not be fully tracked by the limited satellite images. These results suggest that the high-spatial-resolution red-edge index from Sentinel-2 can improve large-scale spatio-temporal GPP assessments.},

However, it remains unclear how the VI-GPP relationship varies with indices, biomes, timescales, and the bidirectional reﬂectance distribution function (BRDF) eﬀect. We examined the relationship between VIs and GPP for 121 FLUXNET sites across the globe and assessed how the VI-GPP relationship varied among a variety of biomes at both monthly and annual timescales. We used three widely-used VIs: normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and 2-band EVI (EVI2) as well as a new VI - NIRV and used surface reﬂectance both with and without BRDF correction from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) to calculate these indices. The resulting traditional (NDVI, EVI, EVI2, and NIRV) and BRDF-corrected (NDVIBRDF, EVIBRDF, EVI2BRDF, and NIRV, BRDF) VIs were used to examine the VI-GPP relationship. At the monthly scale, all VIs were moderate or strong predictors of GPP, and the BRDF correction improved their performance. EVI2BRDF and NIRV, BRDF had similar performance in capturing the variations in tower GPP as did the MODIS GPP product. The VIs explained lower variance in tower GPP at the annual scale than at the monthly scale. The BRDF-correction of surface reﬂectance did not improve the VI-GPP relationship at the annual scale. The VIs had similar capability in capturing the interannual variability in tower GPP as MODIS GPP. VIs were inﬂuenced by temperature and water stresses and were more sensitive to temperature stress than to water stress. VIs in combination with environmental factors could improve the prediction of GPP than VIs alone. Our ﬁndings can help us better understand how the VI-GPP relationship varies among indices, biomes, and timescales and how the BRDF eﬀect inﬂuences the VI-GPP relationship.},

	abstract = {Jump or break detection within a non-stationary time series is a crucial and challenging problem in a broad range of applications including environmental monitoring. Remotely sensed time series are not only non-stationary and unequally spaced (irregularly sampled) but also noisy due to atmospheric effects, such as clouds, haze, and smoke. To address this challenge, a robust method of jump detection is proposed based on the Anti-Leakage Least-Squares Spectral Analysis (ALLSSA) along with an appropriate temporal segmentation. This method, namely, Jumps Upon Spectrum and Trend (JUST), can simultaneously search for trends and statistically signiﬁcant spectral components of each time series segment to identify the potential jumps by considering appropriate weights associated with the time series. JUST is successfully applied to simulated vegetation time series with varying jump location and magnitude, the number of observations, seasonal component, and noises. Using a collection of simulated and real-world vegetation time series in southeastern Australia, it is shown that JUST performs better than Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) in identifying jumps within the trend component of time series with various types. Furthermore, JUST is applied to Landsat 8 composites for a forested region in California, U.S., to show its potential in characterizing spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. Therefore, JUST is recommended as a robust and alternative change detection method which can consider the observational uncertainties and does not require any interpolations and/or gap ﬁllings.},

	abstract = {The development of analytical software for big Earth observation data faces several challenges. Designers need to balance between conﬂicting factors. Solutions that are efﬁcient for speciﬁc hardware architectures can not be used in other environments. Packages that work on generic hardware and open standards will not have the same performance as dedicated solutions. Software that assumes that its users are computer programmers are ﬂexible but may be difﬁcult to learn for a wide audience. This paper describes sits, an open-source R package for satellite image time series analysis using machine learning. To allow experts to use satellite imagery to the fullest extent, sits adopts a time-ﬁrst, space-later approach. It supports the complete cycle of data analysis for land classiﬁcation. Its API provides a simple but powerful set of functions. The software works in different cloud computing environments. Satellite image time series are input to machine learning classiﬁers, and the results are post-processed using spatial smoothing. Since machine learning methods need accurate training data, sits includes methods for quality assessment of training samples. The software also provides methods for validation and accuracy measurement. The package thus comprises a production environment for big EO data analysis. We show that this approach produces high accuracy for land use and land cover maps through a case study in the Cerrado biome, one of the world’s fast moving agricultural frontiers for the year 2018.},

Here, we present the application of deep learning time series separation of leaves and wood from TLS point clouds collected from broad-leaved trees. First, we use a multiple radius nearest neighbor approach to obtain a time series of the geometric features. Second, we compare the performance of Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN), Long Short-Term Memory Fully Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM-FCN), and Residual Network (ResNet) on leaf and wood classiﬁcation. We also compare the effect of univariable (UTS) and multivariable (MTS) time series on classiﬁcation accuracy. Finally, we explore the utilization of a class activation map (CAM) to reduce the black-box effect of deep learning. The average overall accuracy of the MTS method across the training data is 0.96, which is higher than the UTS methods (0.67 to 0.88). Meanwhile, ResNet spent much more time than FCN and LSTM-FCN in model development. When testing our method on an independent dataset, the MTS models based on FCN, LSTM-FCN, and ResNet all demonstrate similar performance. Our method indicates that the CAM can explain the black-box effect of deep learning and suggests that deep learning algorithms coupled with geometric feature time series can accurately separate leaf and woody components from point clouds. This provides a good starting point for future research into estimation of forest structure parameters.},

Not seldom, the decisions and policy measures implemented result in direct or indirect unintended negative impacts, such as on the natural environment, which can vary in time, space, nature, and severity. To achieve a more sustainable world with equitable societies requires fundamental rethinking of our policymaking. It calls for informed decision making and a monitoring of political impact for which evidence-based knowledge is necessary. The most powerful tool to derive objective and systematic spatial information and, thus, add to transparent decisions is remote sensing (RS). This review analyses how spaceborne RS is used by the scientific community to provide evidence for the policymaking process. We reviewed 194 scientific publications from 2015 to 2020 and analysed them based on general insights (e.g., study area) and RS application-related information (e.g., RS data and products). Further, we classified the studies according to their degree of science–policy integration by determining their engagement with the political field and their potential contribution towards four stages of the policy cycle: problem identification/knowledge building, policy formulation, policy implementation, and policy monitoring and evaluation. Except for four studies, we found that studies had not directly involved or informed the policy field or policymaking process. Most studies contributed to the stage problem identification/knowledge building, followed by ex post policy impact assessment. To strengthen the use of RS for policy-relevant studies, the concept of the policy cycle is used to showcase opportunities of RS application for the policymaking process. Topics gaining importance and future requirements of RS at the science–policy interface are identified. If tackled, RS can be a powerful complement to provide policy-relevant evidence to shed light on the impact of political decisions and thus help promote sustainable development from the core.},

	abstract = {An increase in the seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) of atmospheric CO2 since the 1960s has been observed in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). However, the underlying dominant drivers are still debated. The peak season CO2 uptake by vegetation is critical in shaping the CO2 seasonality. Using satellite-upscaled gross primary production (GPP) from FLUXCOM and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV), we demonstrate that peak GPP has increased across the NH over the last two decades. We relate this productivity increase to changes in the CO2 SCA using an atmospheric transport model. The increased photosynthesis has strongly contributed to CO2 SCA trends, but with substantial latitudinal and longitudinal variations. Despite a general increase in the CO2 SCA, there are distinct regional differences. These differences are mainly controlled by regional biosphere carbon fluxes, with the remainder explained by non-biome factors, including large-scale atmospheric transport, changes in fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning and oceanic fluxes. Using the global flask and in situ CO2 measurement sites, we find that SCA trends at high latitude are mainly driven by increasingly productive natural ecosystems, whereas mid latitude sites around the Midwest United States are mainly impacted by intensified agriculture and atmospheric transport. Averaging across the 15 long-term surface sites, forests contribute 26\% (7\%) to the SCA trends, while crops contribute 17\% (24\%) and the combined shrubland, grassland and wetland regions contribute 23\% (37\%) for simulations driven by FLUXCOM (NIRv) ecosystem fluxes. Our findings demonstrate that satellite inferred trends of ecosystem fluxes can capture the observed CO2 SCA trend.},

            Remote sensing techniques are increasingly used for studying ecosystem dynamics, delivering spatially explicit information on the properties of Earth over large spatial and multi-decadal temporal extents. Yet, there is still a gap between the more technology-driven development of novel remote sensing techniques and their applications for studying ecosystem dynamics. Here, I review the existing literature to explore how addressing these gaps might enable recent methods to overcome longstanding challenges in ecological research. First, I trace the emergence of remote sensing as a major tool for understanding ecosystem dynamics. Second, I examine recent developments in the field of remote sensing that are of particular importance for studying ecosystem dynamics. Third, I consider opportunities and challenges for emerging open data and software policies and suggest that remote sensing is at its most powerful when it is theoretically motivated and rigorously ground-truthed. I close with an outlook on four exciting new research frontiers that will define remote sensing ecology in the upcoming decade.},

	abstract = {There is an unprecedented array of new satellite technologies with capabilities for advancing our understanding of ecological processes and the changing composition of the Earth’s biosphere at scales from local plots to the whole planet. We identified 48 instruments and 13 platforms with multiple instruments that are of broad interest to the environmental sciences that either collected data in the 2000s, were recently launched, or are planned for launch in this decade. We have restricted our review to instruments that primarily observe terrestrial landscapes or coastal margins and are available under free and open data policies. We focused on imagers that passively measure wavelengths in the reflected solar and emitted thermal spectrum. The suite of instruments we describe measure land surface characteristics, including land cover, but provide a more detailed monitoring of ecosystems, plant communities, and even some species then possible from historic sensors. The newer instruments have potential to greatly improve our understanding of ecosystem functional relationships among plant traits like leaf mass area (LMA), total nitrogen content, and leaf area index (LAI). They provide new information on physiological processes related to photosynthesis, transpiration and respiration, and stress detection, including capabilities to measure key plant and soil biophysical properties. These include canopy and soil temperature and emissivity, chlorophyll fluorescence, and biogeochemical contents like photosynthetic pigments (e.g., chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phycobiliproteins from cyanobacteria), water, cellulose, lignin, and nitrogen in foliar proteins. These data will enable us to quantify and characterize various soil properties such as iron content, several types of soil clays, organic matter, and other components. Most of these satellites are in low Earth orbit (LEO), but we include a few in geostationary orbit (GEO) because of their potential to measure plant physiological traits over diurnal periods, improving estimates of water and carbon budgets. We also include a few spaceborne active LiDAR and radar imagers designed for quantifying surface topography, changes in surface structure, and 3-dimensional canopy properties such as height, area, vertical profiles, and gap structure. We provide a description of each instrument and tables to summarize their characteristics. Lastly, we suggest instrument synergies that are likely to yield improved results when data are combined.},

            Assessing the seasonal patterns of the Amazon rainforests has been difficult because of the paucity of ground observations and persistent cloud cover over these forests obscuring optical remote sensing observations. Here, we use data from a new generation of geostationary satellites that carry the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) to study the Amazon canopy. ABI is similar to the widely used polar orbiting sensor, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), but provides observations every 10–15 min. Our analysis of NDVI data collected over the Amazon during 2018–19 shows that ABI provides 21–35 times more cloud-free observations in a month than MODIS. The analyses show statistically significant changes in seasonality over 85\% of Amazon forest pixels, an area about three times greater than previously reported using MODIS data. Though additional work is needed in converting the observed changes in seasonality into meaningful changes in canopy dynamics, our results highlight the potential of the new generation geostationary satellites to help us better understand tropical ecosystems, which has been a challenge with only polar orbiting satellites.},

            Vegetation phenology is a key control on water, energy, and carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. Because vegetation canopies are heterogeneous, spatially explicit information related to seasonality in vegetation activity provides valuable information for studies that use eddy covariance measurements to study ecosystem function and land-atmosphere interactions. Here we present a land surface phenology (LSP) dataset derived at 3 m spatial resolution from PlanetScope imagery across a range of plant functional types and climates in North America. The dataset provides spatially explicit information related to the timing of phenophase changes such as the start, peak, and end of vegetation activity, along with vegetation index metrics and associated quality assurance flags for the growing seasons of 2017–2021 for 10 × 10 km windows centred over 104 eddy covariance towers at AmeriFlux and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites. These LSP data can be used to analyse processes controlling the seasonality of ecosystem-scale carbon, water, and energy fluxes, to evaluate predictions from land surface models, and to assess satellite-based LSP products.},

            Land, atmosphere and climate interact constantly and at different spatial and temporal scales. In this paper we rely on causal discovery methods to infer spatial patterns of causal relations between several key variables of the carbon and water cycles: gross primary productivity, latent heat energy flux for evaporation, surface air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture and radiation. We introduce a methodology based on the convergent cross-mapping (CCM) technique. Despite its good performance in general, CCM is sensitive to (even moderate) noise levels and hyper-parameter selection. We present a robust CCM (RCCM) that relies on temporal bootstrapping decision scores and the derivation of more stringent cross-map skill scores. The RCCM method is combined with the information-geometric causal inference (IGCI) method to address the problem of strong and instantaneous variable coupling, another important and long-standing issue of CCM. The proposed methodology allows to derive spatially explicit global maps of causal relations between the involved variables and retrieve the underlying complexity of the interactions. Results are generally consistent with reported patterns and process understanding, and constitute a new way to quantify and understand carbon and water fluxes interactions.},

              Earth system models predict that increases in atmospheric and soil dryness will reduce photosynthesis in the Amazon rainforest, with large implications for the global carbon cycle. Using in situ observations, solar-induced fluorescence, and nonlinear machine learning techniques, we show that, in reality, this is not necessarily the case: In many of the wettest parts of this region, photosynthesis and biomass tend to increase with increased atmospheric dryness, despite the associated reductions in canopy conductance to CO

              . These results can be largely explained by changes in canopy properties, specifically, new leaves flushed during the dry season have higher photosynthetic capacity than the leaves they replace, compensating for the negative stomatal response to increased dryness. As atmospheric dryness will increase with climate change, our study highlights the importance of reframing how we represent the response of ecosystem photosynthesis to atmospheric dryness in very wet regions, to accurately quantify the land carbon sink.},

              Empirical vegetation indices derived from spectral reflectance data are widely used in remote sensing of the biosphere, as they represent robust proxies for canopy structure, leaf pigment content, and, subsequently, plant photosynthetic potential. Here, we generalize the broad family of commonly used vegetation indices by exploiting all higher-order relations between the spectral channels involved. This results in a higher sensitivity to vegetation biophysical and physiological parameters. The presented nonlinear generalization of the celebrated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) consistently improves accuracy in monitoring key parameters, such as leaf area index, gross primary productivity, and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. Results suggest that the statistical approach maximally exploits the spectral information and addresses long-standing problems in satellite Earth Observation of the terrestrial biosphere.

The seasonality of ecosystem processes, including biogeochemical fluxes, can similarly be decomposed to identify key transition points and phase durations, which can be determined with high accuracy, and are specific to the processes of interest. As the seasonality of different processes differ, it 10 can be argued that the interannual trends and responses to environmental forcings can be better described through the fluxes’ own temporal characteristics than through correlation to traditional phenological events like bud-break or leaf coloration. Here we present a global dataset of seasonality or phenological metrics calculated for gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE), latent heat (LE) and sensible heat (H) calculated for the FLUXNET 2015 Dataset of about 200 sites and 1500 site-years of data. The database includes metrics (i) on absolute flux scale for comparisons with flux magnitudes, and (ii) on 15 normalized scale for comparisons of change rates across different fluxes. Flux seasonality was characterized by fitting a singlepass double-logistic model to daily flux integrals, and the derivatives of the fitted time series were used to extract the phenological metrics marking key turning points, season lengths and rates of change. Seasonal transition points could be determined with 95\% confidence interval of 6-11 days for GPP, 8-14 days for RE, 10-15 days for LE and 15-23 days for H.

While a number of strategies for empirical models with eddy-covariance flux data have been applied, a systematic intercomparison of these methods has been missing so far. In this study, we performed a cross-validation experiment for predicting carbon dioxide, latent heat, sensible heat and net radiation fluxes across different ecosystem types with 11 machine learning (ML) methods from four different classes (kernel methods, neural networks, tree methods, and regression splines). We applied two complementary setups: (1) 8-day average fluxes based on remotely sensed data and (2) daily mean fluxes based on meteorological data and a mean seasonal cycle of remotely sensed variables. The patterns of predictions from different ML and experimental setups were highly consistent. There were systematic differences in performance among the fluxes, with the following ascending order: net ecosystem exchange (R2 {\textless} 0.5), ecosystem respiration (R2 {\textgreater} 0.6), gross primary production (R2{\textgreater} 0.7), latent heat (R2 {\textgreater} 0.7), sensible heat (R2 {\textgreater} 0.7), and net radiation (R2 {\textgreater} 0.8). The ML methods predicted the across-site variability and the mean seasonal cycle of the observed fluxes very well (R2 {\textgreater} 0.7), while the 8-day deviations from the mean seasonal cycle were not well predicted (R2 {\textless} 0.5). Fluxes were better predicted at forested and temperate climate sites than at sites in extreme climates or less represented by training data (e.g., the tropics). The evaluated large ensemble of ML-based models will be the basis of new global flux products.},

However, although global GPP estimates exist, each data set relies upon assumptions and none of the available data are based only on measurements. Consequently, there is no consensus on the global total GPP and large uncertainties exist in its benchmarking. The objective of this review is to assess how the different available data sets predict the spatiotemporal patterns of GPP, identify the differences among data sets, and highlight the main advantages/disadvantages of each data set. We compare GPP estimates for the historical period (1990–2009) from two observation-based data sets (Model Tree Ensemble and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to coupled carbon-climate models and terrestrial carbon cycle models from the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project and TRENDY projects and to a new hybrid data set (CARBONES). Results show a large range in the mean global GPP estimates. The different data sets broadly agree on GPP seasonal cycle in terms of phasing, while there is still discrepancy on the amplitude. For interannual variability (IAV) and trends, there is a clear separation between the observation-based data that show little IAV and trend, while the process-based models have large GPP variability and signiﬁcant trends. These results suggest that there is an urgent need to improve observation-based data sets and develop carbon cycle modeling with processes that are currently treated either very simplistically to correctly estimate present GPP and better quantify the future uptake of carbon dioxide by the world’s vegetation.},

              As climate change accelerates, it is important to know the likely impact of climate change on the carbon cycle (see the Perspective by
              
                Reich
              
              ). Gross primary production (GPP) is a measure of the amount of CO
              2
              removed from the atmosphere every year to fuel photosynthesis.

              , published online 5 July) used a combination of observation and calculation to estimate that the total GPP by terrestrial plants is around 122 billion tons per year; in comparison, burning fossil fuels emits about 7 billion tons annually. Thirty-two percent of this uptake occurs in tropical forests, and precipitation controls carbon uptake in more than 40\% of vegetated land. The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of ecosystem respiratory processes is a key determinant of the interaction between climate and the carbon cycle.

              , published online 5 July) now show that the Q10 of ecosystem respiration is invariant with respect to mean annual temperature, independent of the analyzed ecosystem type, with a global mean value for Q10 of 1.6. This level of temperature sensitivity suggests a less-pronounced climate sensitivity of the carbon cycle than assumed by recent climate models.

              Terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) is the largest global CO
              2
              flux driving several ecosystem functions. We provide an observation-based estimate of this flux at 123 ± 8 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year

              ) using eddy covariance flux data and various diagnostic models. Tropical forests and savannahs account for 60\%. GPP over 40\% of the vegetated land is associated with precipitation. State-of-the-art process-oriented biosphere models used for climate predictions exhibit a large between-model variation of GPP’s latitudinal patterns and show higher spatial correlations between GPP and precipitation, suggesting the existence of missing processes or feedback mechanisms which attenuate the vegetation response to climate. Our estimates of spatially distributed GPP and its covariation with climate can help improve coupled climate–carbon cycle process models.},

	abstract = {Plant coverage is a basic indicator of the biomass production in ecosystems. On the Tibetan Plateau, the biomass of grasslands provides major ecosystem services with regard to the predominant transhumance economy. The pastures, however, are threatened by progressive degradation, resulting in a substantial reduction in plant coverage with currently unknown consequences for the hydrological/climate regulation function of the plateau and the major river systems of SE Asia that depend on it and provide water for the adjacent lowlands. Thus, monitoring of changes in plant coverage is of utmost importance, but no reliable tools have been available to date to monitor the changes on the entire plateau. Due to the wide extent and remoteness of the Tibetan Plateau, remote sensing is the only tool that can recurrently provide area-wide data for monitoring purposes. In this study, we develop and present a grassland-cover product based on multi-sensor satellite data that is applicable for monitoring at three spatial resolutions (WorldView type at 2–5 m, Landsat type at 30 m, MODIS at 500 m), where the data of the latter resolution cover the entire plateau. Four different retrieval techniques to derive plant coverage from satellite data in boreal summer (JJA) were tested. The underlying statistical models are derived with the help of ﬁeld observations of the cover at 640 plots and 14 locations, considering the main grassland vegetation types of the Tibetan Plateau. To provide a product for the entire Tibetan Plateau, plant coverage estimates derived by means of the higher-resolution data were upscaled to MODIS composites acquired between 2011 and 2013. An accuracy assessment of the retrieval methods revealed best results for the retrieval using support vector machine regressions (RMSE: 9.97\%, 7.13\% and 5.51\% from the WorldView to the MODIS scale). The retrieved values coincide well with published coverage data on the different grassland vegetation types.},

	abstract = {Empirical modeling approaches are frequently used to upscale local eddy covariance observations of carbon, water, and energy ﬂuxes to regional and global scales. The predictive capacity of such models largely depends on the data used for parameterization and identiﬁcation of input-output relationships, while prediction for conditions outside the training domain is generally uncertain. In this work, artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) were used for the prediction of gross primary production (GPP) and latent heat ﬂux (LE) on local and European scales with the aim to assess the portion of uncertainties in extrapolation due to sample selection. ANNs were found to be a useful tool for GPP and LE prediction, in particular for extrapolation in time (mean absolute error MAE for GPP between 0.53 and 1.56 gC mÀ2 dÀ1). Extrapolation in space in similar climatic and vegetation conditions also gave good results (GPP MAE 0.7–1.41 gC mÀ2 dÀ1), while extrapolation in areas with different seasonal cycles and controlling factors (e.g., the tropical regions) showed noticeably higher errors (GPP MAE 0.8–2.09 gC mÀ2 dÀ1). The distribution and the number of sites used for ANN training had a remarkable effect on prediction uncertainty in both, regional GPP and LE budgets and their interannual variability. Results obtained show that for ANN upscaling for continents with relatively small networks of sites, the error due to the sampling can be large and needs to be considered and quantiﬁed. The analysis of the spatial variability of the uncertainty helped to identify the meteorological drivers driving the uncertainty.},

However, many elements contribute to the uncertainty of such estimate. In this study, the uncertainties of eight days gross primary production (GPP) predicted by Random Forest (RF) machine learning models were analysed at the site, ecosystem and European spatial scales. At the site level, the uncertainties caused by the missing of key drivers were evaluated. The most accurate predictions of eight days GPP were obtained when all available drivers were used (Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient, ρ {\textasciitilde} 0.84; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) {\textasciitilde} 1.8 g C m−2 d−1). However, when predictions were based on only remotely sensed data the accuracy was close to the optimum (ρ {\textasciitilde} 0.8; RMSE {\textasciitilde} 1.9 g C m−2 d−1) and to a commonly used light use efﬁciency model (MOD17) with parameters optimised for the applied study sites (the MOD17+, ρ {\textasciitilde} 0.79; RMSE {\textasciitilde} 2.04 g C m−2 d−1). Remotely sensed data were key drivers for the accurate prediction of GPP in ecosystems with high variability of green biomass over the phenological cycle (e.g., deciduous broad-leaved forests) or highly affected by the human management (e.g. croplands). In contrast, in the ecosystems with low variability of greenness (e.g., evergreen broad-leaved forests), the predictions were poor when meteorological information were not used. At a European spatial scale, when modelled grids of meteorological, land cover and fPAR data were used as inputs, the propagation of their uncertainty, not accounted in the models training, had signiﬁcant effects on the uncertainty of the mean annual GPP. At this scale, the effects of meteorological uncertainty were higher than the misclassiﬁcation error. These ﬁndings suggested that a strategy based on satellite-measured data could be a favourable improvement for the spatial upscaling of GPP, because avoiding the propagation of the uncertainties of the modelled grids.},

The parametric approach involves comparison of established and generic narrowband vegetation indices (VIs) and the Normalized Area Over reﬂectance Curve method, which calculates the continuum spectral region sensitive to Chl. However, as not all available bands take part in these spectral algorithms, it remains unclear whether optimal estimations are achieved. Alternatively, the nonparametric approach is based on Gaussian process (GP) techniques and allows inclusion of all bands. GP builds a nonlinear regression as a linear combination of spectra mapped to a high-dimensional space. Moreover, GP provides an indication of the most contributing bands for each parameter, a weight for the most relevant spectra contained in the training data set, and a conﬁdence estimate of the retrieval. GP has previously demonstrated to be competitive in accuracy with support vector regression and neural networks. Results from hyperspectral Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data over the Spanish Barrax test site show that GP outperformed the VIs in assessing the vegetation properties when using at least four out of the 62 bands. GP identiﬁed most contributing bands in the red and red edge and, to a lower extent, in the blue and NIR parts of the spectrum. Since the proposed GP method is able to build robust relationships between the parameter of interest and only a few bands, it is a promising approach for multispectral data as well.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a uniﬁed framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identiﬁcation of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class uniﬁes six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this uniﬁcation, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

            Spectral Indices derived from multispectral remote sensing products are extensively used to monitor Earth system dynamics (e.g. vegetation dynamics, water bodies, fire regimes). The rapid increase of proposed spectral indices led to a high demand for catalogues of spectral indices and tools for their computation. However, most of these resources are either closed-source, outdated, unconnected to a catalogue or lacking a common Application Programming Interface (API). Here we present “Awesome Spectral Indices” (ASI), a standardized catalogue of spectral indices for Earth system research. ASI provides a comprehensive machine readable catalogue of spectral indices, which is linked to a Python library. ASI delivers a broad set of attributes for each spectral index, including names, formulas, and source references. The catalogue can be extended by the user community, ensuring that ASI remains current and enabling a wider range of scientific applications. Furthermore, the Python library enables the application of the catalogue to real-world data and thereby facilitates the efficient use of remote sensing resources in multiple Earth system domains.},

However, VI-based results can vary between indices, sensors, quality control measures, compositing algorithms, and atmospheric and sun–target–sensor geometry corrections. These variations make it difficult to draw robust conclusions about ecosystem change and highlight the need for consistent VI application and verification. In this Technical Review, we summarize the history and ecological applications of VIs and the linkages and inconsistencies between them. VIs have been used since the early 1970s and have evolved rapidly with the emergence of new satellite sensors with more spectral channels, new scientific demands and advances in spectroscopy. When choosing VIs, the spectral sensitivity and features of VIs and their suitability for target application should be considered. During data analyses, steps must be taken to minimize the impact of artefacts, VI results should be verified with in situ data when possible and conclusions should be based on multiple sets of indicators. Next-generation VIs with higher signal-to-noise ratios and fewer artefacts will be possible with new satellite missions and integration with emerging vegetation metrics such as solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, providing opportunities for studying terrestrial ecosystems globally.},

	abstract = {Quantifying ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks is essential for better understanding the global carbon cycle and improving projections of the carbon-climate feedbacks. Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solarinduced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50 years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.},

	abstract = {Satellite-based light use efficiency (LUE) models are important tools for estimating regional and global vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP). However, all LUE models assume a constant value of maximum LUE at canopy scale (LUEmaxcanopy) over a given vegetation type. This assumption is not supported by observed plant traits regulating LUEmaxcanopy, which varies greatly even within the same ecosystem type. In this study, we developed an improved satellite data driven GPP model by identifying the potential maximal GPP (GPPPOT) and their dominant climate control factor in various plant functional types (PFT), which takes into account both plant trait and climatic control inter-dependence. We selected 161 sites from the FLUXNET2015 dataset with eddy covariance CO2 flux data and continuous meteorology to derive GPPPOT and their dominant climate control factor of vegetation growth for 42 natural PFTs. Results showed that (1) under the same phenology and incident photosynthetic active radiation, the maximal variance of GPPPOT is found in different PFTs of forests (10.9 g C m−2 day−1) and in different climatic zones of grasslands ({\textgreater}10 g C m−2 day−1); (2) intra-annual change of GPP in tropical and arid climate zones is mostly driven by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) changes, while temperature is the dominant climate control factor in temperate, boreal and polar climate zones; even under the same climate condition, physiological stress in photosynthesis is different across PFTs; (3) the model that takes into account the plant trait difference across PFTs had a higher agreement with flux tower-based GPP data (GPPflux) than the GPP products that omit PFT differences. Such agreement was highest for natural vegetation cover sites (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 1.79 g C m−2 day−1). These results suggest that global scale GPP models should incorporate both plant traits and their dominant climate control factor variance in various PFT to reduce the uncertainties in terrestrial carbon assessments.},

Representative canopy reflectance and NDVI data were simulated for historical, current and future AVHRR, MODIS and VIIRS land surface monitoring satellites to quantify the differences due to sensor-specific characteristics. Cross-sensor NDVI translation equations were developed for surface conditions. The effect of a range of atmospheric conditions (Rayleigh scattering, ozone, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor content) on the sensor-specific reflectance and NDVI values were evaluated to quantify the uncertainty in the apparent NDVI for each sensor. MODIS and VIIRS NDVI data are minimally affected by the atmospheric water vapor, while AVHRR NDVI data are substantially reduced by water vapor.},

Global monthly absolute and relative uncertainties, in 0.05° spatial resolutions, were generated for MODIS, CYCLOPES, and GLOBCARBON LAI products, with reasonable agreement in terms of spatial patterns and biome types. CYCLOPES shows the lowest absolute and relative uncertainties, followed by GLOBCARBON and MODIS. Grasses, crops, shrubs, and savannas usually have lower uncertainties than forests in association with the relatively larger forest LAI. With their densely vegetated canopies, tropical regions exhibit the highest absolute uncertainties but the lowest relative uncertainties, the latter of which tend to increase with higher latitudes. The estimated uncertainties of CYCLOPES generally meet the quality requirements (± 0.5) proposed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), whereas for MODIS and GLOBCARBON only non-forest biome types have met the requirement. Nevertheless, none of the products seems to be within a relative uncertainty requirements of 20\%. Further independent validation and comparative studies are expected to provide a fair assessment of uncertainties derived from TCEM. Overall, the proposed TCEM is straightforward and could be automated for the systematic processing of real time remote sensing observations to provide theoretical uncertainty information for a wider range of land products.},

            A large proportion of the world’s forest is highly fragmented, but our understanding of forest carbon dynamics and their response to climate largely comes from unfragmented forests, which presents an important mismatch between landscapes that we study and those that we aim to characterize. We find that temperate broadleaf forest growth and biomass in southern New England increase substantially from forest interior to edge. However, forest growth reductions with climate stress increase with proximity to the edge, pointing to important interactions between forest fragmentation and climate change. We show that, by not accounting for edge effects, current approaches to quantifying regional and global carbon balance may underestimate carbon sequestration and not accurately represent forest growth response to future climate change.

            Forest fragmentation is a ubiquitous, ongoing global phenomenon with profound impacts on the growing conditions of the world’s remaining forest. The temperate broadleaf forest makes a large contribution to the global terrestrial carbon sink but is also the most heavily fragmented forest biome in the world. We use field measurements and geospatial analyses to characterize carbon dynamics in temperate broadleaf forest fragments. We show that forest growth and biomass increase by 89 ± 17\% and 64 ± 12\%, respectively, from the forest interior to edge, but ecosystem edge enhancements are not currently captured by models or approaches to quantifying regional C balance. To the extent that the findings from our research represent the forest of southern New England in the United States, we provide a preliminary estimate that edge growth enhancement could increase estimates of the region’s carbon uptake and storage by 13 ± 3\% and 10 ± 1\%, respectively. However, we also find that forest growth near the edge declines three times faster than that in the interior in response to heat stress during the growing season. Using climate projections, we show that future heat stress could reduce the forest edge growth enhancement by one-third by the end of the century. These findings contrast studies of edge effects in the world’s other major forest biomes and indicate that the strength of the temperate broadleaf forest carbon sink and its capacity to mitigate anthropogenic carbon emissions may be stronger, but also more sensitive to climate change than previous estimates suggest.},

	abstract = {Forest fragmentation is pervasive throughout the world's forests, impacting growing conditions and carbon (C) dynamics through edge effects that produce gradients in microclimate, biogeochemistry, and stand structure. Despite the majority of global forests being {\textless}1 km from an edge, our understanding of forest C dynamics is largely derived from intact forest systems. Edge effects on the C cycle vary by biome in their direction and magnitude, but current forest C accounting methods and ecosystem models generally fail to include edge effects. In the mesic northeastern
              US
              , large increases in C stocks and productivity are found near the temperate forest edge, with over 23\% of the forest area within 30 m of an edge. Changes in the wind, fire, and moisture regimes near tropical forest edges result in decreases in C stocks and productivity. This review explores differences in C dynamics observed across biomes through a trade‐offs framework that considers edge microenvironmental changes and limiting factors to productivity.},
