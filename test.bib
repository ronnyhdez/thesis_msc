	abstract = {We introduce the C++ application and R package ranger. The software is a fast implementation of random forests for high dimensional data. Ensembles of classiﬁcation, regression and survival trees are supported. We describe the implementation, provide examples, validate the package with a reference implementation, and compare runtime and memory usage with other implementations. The new software proves to scale best with the number of features, samples, trees, and features tried for splitting. Finally, we show that ranger is the fastest and most memory eﬃcient implementation of random forests to analyze data on the scale of a genome-wide association study.},
