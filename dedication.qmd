# Dedication {.unnumbered}

_If you can keep your leaves when all about you, are losing theirs and blaming it on drought; If you can photosynthesize when others shut their stomates and stop transpiring; yours will be the canopy and all beneath it and -which is more-you'll be a tree, my seed._    

                    - Jennifer L. Funk digression from Rudyard Kipling "If" poem

_"No one gets anywhere without the help of someone else."_   

                    - Franklin Chang DÃ­az
