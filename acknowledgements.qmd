<!-- I want to thank my supervisor Arturo SÃ¡nchez who gave me the opportunity to -->
<!-- come to Canada, but specially for encouraging me to purse grad studies. During -->
<!-- my thesis and the ups and downs, Richard Fernandes was there to push me further -->
<!-- and guide me through a research area that has turned into something really -->
<!-- interesting to me. -->
