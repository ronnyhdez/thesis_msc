# Conclusions and Future Work

## Synthesis

This research evaluated the advantages and limitations associated with
estimating GPP using traditional VIs like NDVI, EVI, and recent ones like CCI
and NIRv. Specifically, the study focused on VIs derived from MODIS, chosen for
its extensive time records. To assess GPP estimates through the VIs, we employed
traditional methods such as linear regression and GAM, as well as ML techniques.

Traditional methods, such as LM and GAM, offer the advantage of being more
straightforward to interpret in relation to their predictions and associated
errors. In contrast, ML techniques like regression RF and autoML pursue
predictions through methods that are harder to elucidate, a phenomenon referred
to as "black model boxes." Despite their complexity, these ML methods have the
potential to achieve superior accuracy in their predictions.

To evaluate the capacity of VIs to estimate GPP,Productivity (GPP), our analysis
spanned three temporal aggregations: daily, weekly, and monthly. This assessment
considered the utilization of VIs individually or collectively as covariates in
the model. For ML methods, the same temporal aggregations were employed, with an
assessment involving all indices and the entire set of MODIS bands as
predictors.

The results indicate that, across all models, monthly temporal aggregation
consistently yields better outcomes in comparison to weekly and daily
aggregations. This superiority can be attributed to the reduced variation
present in monthly aggregated data, resulting in lower errors in the models.
According to LM and GAM,  incorporating all indices as covariates in the models
enhances predictive capability, suggesting that a single VI in isolation may
fall short of capturing the entire variation in the data.

Examining the outcomes of models utilizing individual VIs reveals minimal
differences. Nonetheless, VIs consistently displaying a slightly superior
performance in terms of explained variation and lower error are typically EVI
and CCI, whereas NDVI tends to exhibit lower performance. This trend is also
evident in ML models, with EVI and CCI frequently occupying top positions in
variable of importance rankings. In ML models, the inclusion of all bands as
predictors highlights that B02 (NIR) often ranks among the top variables in
importance over other bands.

In comparing the various models and their configurations (LM and GAM with VIs as
covariates; RF and autoML with VIs and complete bands as predictors), it becomes
evident that ML methods exhibit a better performance across different time
aggregations. For daily models, assessed by RÂ² and RMSE metrics, RF surpassed
autoML, GAM, and LM, in that sequence. For the weekly models, autoML led,
followed by GAM, LM, and RF. Regarding the monthly models, RF had better
performance, followed by LM, autoML, and GAM.
