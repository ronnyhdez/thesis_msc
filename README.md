 - This is a repository by [Ronny A. Hernández Mora](https://ronnyale.com/) that contains all
 the code and text to produce my [thesis document](https://github.com/ronnyhdez/thesis_msc/blob/main/thesis_docs/Assessing-uncertainties-related-to-the-use-of-satellite-remote-sensing-indices-to-estimate-Gross-Primary-Production_v0.0.6.pdf).
 - This repository also contains my [slides](https://github.com/ronnyhdez/thesis_msc/blob/main/thesis_docs/thesis_presentation_v0.0.3.pdf) used in my MSc defense

:warning: Thesis dissertation may differ from the official document submitted to
the University of Alberta Faculty of Graduate Studies & Research in aspects such
as  **text format**, **references section position**, or **first page structure**.
However, these differences relate to formatting rather than content or data 
analysis results.

## :open_book: Open Science Statement

All materials, data, and code required to reproduce my research and thesis are 
made available here, to the best of my knowledge and abilities.

If you encounter an error while attempting to replicate a part of the analysis, 
please inform me by [creating an issue](https://github.com/ronnyhdez/thesis_msc/issues/new).
