# Assessing uncertainties related to the use of satellite remote sensing indices to estimate Gross Primary Production

![GitHub release (with filter)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ronnyhdez/thesis_msc) 

 - This is a repository by [Ronny A. Hernández Mora](https://ronnyale.com/) that contains all
 the code and text to produce my [thesis document](https://github.com/ronnyhdez/thesis_msc/blob/main/thesis_docs/Assessing-uncertainties-related-to-the-use-of-satellite-remote-sensing-indices-to-estimate-Gross-Primary-Production_v0.0.6.pdf).
 - This repository also contains my [slides](https://github.com/ronnyhdez/thesis_msc/blob/main/thesis_docs/thesis_presentation_v0.0.3.pdf) used in my MSc defense

:warning: Thesis dissertation may differ from the official document submitted to
the University of Alberta Faculty of Graduate Studies & Research in aspects such
as  **text format**, **references section position**, or **first page structure**.
However, these differences relate to formatting rather than content or data 
analysis results.
