# Introduction

The study and assessment of ecosystem dynamics have greatly benefited from the
development and advances of the remote sensing field [@running_continuous_2004; @baldocchi_how_2020-1]
coupled with the growing freely available remote sensing resources [@montero_standardized_2023]. Elements in the Earth
surface exhibit distinctive spectral signatures arising from their physical
properties and interactions with electromagnetic radiation. Environmental
factors can affect these interactions modifying the spectral signatures which
can provide insights about surface process [@montero_standardized_2023].

The launch in the 1970's of the  Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS),
later known as Landsat-1 [[Advances in remote sensing of vegetation function and
traits|Houburg et al 2015]], initiated a new era in the remote sensing field of
the terrestrial biosphere, with a special focus on vegetation monitoring [@montero_standardized_2023]. With information available
about spectral bands, studies about their relations to biophysical
characteristics became an object of study to estimate biomass and photosynthetic
activity [[1-s2.0-S0304380019303230-main.pdf|Myneni et al 1997]]

In fact, one application of remote sensing have been the development of
vegetation indices to study the characteristics of vegetation canopies and
functioning [[Advances in remote sensing of vegetation function and
traits|Houburg et al 2015]] Vegetation indices can give us information about the
status of the vegetation given the information derived from mathematical
equations from the values of two or more spectral bands, typically derived from
satellite images. [[Optical vegetation indices for monitoring terrestrial
ecosystems globally|Zeng et al 2022]]. Their interpretation is based on the
theoretical background about the interaction of the ligth with vegetation
[[Optical vegetation indices for monitoring terrestrial ecosystems globally|Zeng
et al 2022]]

Early studies about spectral bands relations, lead to the development of the
NDVI which showed how the NIR and Red ratio had advantages over other bands
ratios for monitoring vegetation [[ Red and photographic Infrared linear
combinations for monitoring vegetation|Tucker 1979]].  It rationale lays in the
interplay of  the chlorophyll absorbing red spectral region with the
non-absorbing leaf reflectance signal in the NIR region, that can give optical
measurements of the vegetation greenness and other biophysical processes.
[[MODISVI_Huete-etal2011book.pdf|Huete et al 2011]]

One of the advantages of NDVI is that the ratio normalize values with large
variances [[MODISVI_Huete-etal2011book.pdf|Huete et al 2011]]. Nonetheless, this
VI have disadvantages such as sensitivy to soil background and saturation at
high biomass [[MODISVI_Huete-etal2011book.pdf|Huete et al 2002]]. To overcome
this problem, the EVI was designed to improve vegetation characterizations such
as canopy greenness without soil background sensitivity and aerosol variations
by combining the blue, red, and NIR bands [[MODISVI_Huete-etal2011book.pdf|Huete
et al 1988]]. EVI is also less prone to saturate at high biomass instances
[[MODISVI_Huete-etal2011book.pdf|Gao et al 2000]]

The ability to combine spectral regions, coupled with advancements and  the
development of new sensor technologies introducing additional bands or different
spectral characteristics, has created opportunities to develop multiple VIs  and
the total number of indices have grown steadily [[s41597-023-02096-0.pdf|17,
18]] [@montero_standardized_2023]. These equations
can function as proxies for various vegetation canopy properties or enhance
existing estimations across different ecosystems
[[MODISVI_Huete-etal2011book.pdf|Huete et al 2011]].

According to the Awesome Spectral Indices open community catalogue (version
4.0.0), there are 127 spectral indices designed to monitor vegetation. The aim
behind the ongoing development of new VIs is to achieve a more accurate mapping
of ecosystem processes ~~such as GPP~~. [@montero_standardized_2023].  These indices can be classified into 3 main categories:
biophysical, biochemical and physiological properties [[Optical vegetation
indices for monitoring terrestrial ecosystems globally|Zeng et al 2022]]
~~Describe the categories~~

One important metric to understand ecosystems processes ~~and health~~ is GPP.
At the time, VIs derived from satellites cannot directly estimate GPP
[[Gensheimer et al. - 2022 - A convolutional neural network for spatial
downsca.pdf|Gensheimer et al 2022]] and instead, instruments like eddy
covariance have been the traditional method to estimate GPP more directly
[[Baldocchi 2019]].

GPP represents the overall quantity of leaf photosynthesis, playing a crucial
role in the carbon cycle  [[Remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle A
review of advances over 50 years|Xiao et al 2019]]. GPP is responsive to a range
of factors, including abiotic elements such as radiation, temperature, and
precipitation  [[Pabon-Moreno et al_2022_On the potential of Sentinel-2 for
estimating Gross Primary Production.pdf|2,3]], as well as biotic factors like
vegetation type, leaf chemical traits, and species composition  [[Pabon-Moreno
et al_2022_On the potential of Sentinel-2 for estimating Gross Primary
Production.pdf|4]].

Some of the carbon taken in by GPP is release back to the atmosphere through
plant respiration (autotrophic respiration), and the difference between GPP and
plant respiration  is called Net Primary Productivity (NPP) [Xiao et al., 2019].
GPP, along with Ecosystem Respiration (ER), which includes both autotrophic and
heterotrophic respiration, together determines Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE)
[Xiao et al., 2019].

EC is a method used to measure the exchange of energy and materials between
ecosystems and the atmosphere within an area that can range from a few hundred
meters to a few kilometers [@pabon-moreno_potential_2022]. Specifically, EC systems
measure NEE, which has to be break down into its parts: GPP and respiration
~~for quantifycation~~ [Reichstein et al., 2005]. Despite being a more directly
method to estimate GPP,  EC systems have a spatial constrain that depends on the
tower flux footprint. [[Buscar]]

Since direct GPP measurements from satellites are not presently available, one
of the primary objectives of remote sensing is to enhance GPP estimation
accuracy without the spatial constriction [[Remote sensing of the terrestrial
carbon cycle A review of advances over 50 years|Xiao et al 2019]]. In this
context, EC values prove invaluable as a comparative metric when contrasting VIs
values with GPP inferred from flux towers [[Huete et al 2006]]. The utilization
of EC measurements bridges the gap in GPP assessment, providing a practical
means to evaluate and refine the reliability of remotely sensed data against
ground-based observations [[Buscar]]. This methodological approach aligns with
the overarching goal of leveraging remote sensing techniques to advance our
understanding  of the magnitude, spatial patterns, interannual variability and
long-term trends of ecosystem Carbon dynamics at landscape, regional and global
scales.  [[Remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle A review of advances
over 50 years|Xiao et al 2019]]

Various methods exist for estimating GPP through satellite measurements.
Satellite-derived VIs serve as commonly employed proxies for GPP, whereas
quantifying GPP more directly often involves the use of Light Use Efficiency
(LUE) models,  and process-based models  [[Remote sensing of the terrestrial
carbon cycle A review of advances over 50 years|Xiao et al 2019]] . These
diverse methodologies cater to different aspects of GPP estimation, with
satellite-derived VIs offering a convenient indirect assessment, while LUE
models, and process-based models provide more detailed and direct quantification
[[Improved global estimations of gross primary productivity of natural
vegetation types by incorporating plant functional type|Lin et al 2021]].

The concept of a more detailed and direct quantification of GPP achieved through
LUE and process-based models can be attributed to the incorporation of a
constant maximal light use efficiency, which is a plant functional type
dependent parameter which is down regulated by stress factors such as
temperature and vapor pressure deficit [@pabon-moreno_potential_2022]. This approach
is then integrated with APAR derived from remote sensing data to estimate GPP in
the case of LUE models  [@running_continuous_2004]. In contrast, process-based models distinguish
themselves by prioritizing a mechanistic description of the photosynthetic
biochemical processes at both leaf and canopy scales, incorporating the
comprehensive theoretical underpinnings of photosynthesis  [[Improved global
estimations of gross primary productivity of natural vegetation types by
incorporating plant functional type|Ryu et al 2011]]. This methodology not only
refines GPP quantification but also offers a more in-depth understanding of the
underlying physiological processes governing vegetation productivity.
However, both Light Use Efficiency (LUE) models and process-based models demand
a multitude of inputs, some of which may not be readily available for all sites.
In such cases, a data-driven approach becomes particularly advantageous, and VIs
serve as effective proxies for GPP estimation. Notably, emerging VIs like NIRv
demonstrate a capability to account for 68% of the monthly variability in GPP
across fluxnet sites [[Pabon-Moreno et al_2022_On the potential of Sentinel-2
for estimating Gross Primary Production.pdf|Badgley et al 2019]]. Additionally,
indices such as CCI have exhibited proficiency as estimators of GPP in specific
forest types, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of vegetation
productivity.

Despite the notable progress in VIs development and their user-friendly
applications, their effective use demands a experience and a strong theoretical
background to navigate potential pitfalls and ensure accurate and meaningful
interpretations of the data [[Optical vegetation indices for monitoring
terrestrial ecosystems globally|Zeng et al 2022]]. There is a consensus that no
single VI can be universally applied to address every problem or situation.
Thus, a meticulous understanding of the specific context and characteristics of
the site is essential to derive more accurate and insightful information from
the data [[Optical vegetation indices for monitoring terrestrial ecosystems
globally|Zeng et al 2022]]

Uncertainty poses additional challenges to remote sensing applications, with
diverse sources affecting satellite-derived data, including atmospheric effects,
retrieval errors, cloud contamination, and sensor degradation [[Remote sensing
of the terrestrial carbon cycle A review of advances over 50 years|van Leuween
et al 2006; Fang et al 2012]]. Another contributing factor to uncertainties lies
in the variations of carbon uptake and storage, which can be higher in forest
edges. [[Reinmann and Hutrya 2017]] The prevalent practice of taking
measurements primarily from intact forests introduces the risk of potentially
misleading estimations for the broader forest being quantified, given the
potential differences in dynamics between edge and interior environments
[[smith et al 2018]].

Moreover, while emerging indices show promise as better proxies for
physiological processes, ongoing technological developments have limitations in
terms of spatial/temporal resolution which can still be not the best to conduct
more studies that can be applied easily to more ecosystems [[Optical vegetation
indices for monitoring terrestrial ecosystems globally|Zeng et al 2022]] One
notable example is SIF, which holds the advantage of being directly related to
photosynthetic activity [[buscar]]. In contrast, Vegetation Indices (VIs) are
primarily associated with photosynthetic capacity [[Sellers 1985]]

Together with the advancement of new VIs, there has been a upsurge in data
analysis methods, specifically Machine Learning (ML) approaches, has garnered
significance in recent years. The capability of ML methods to navigate
non-linear relationships proves crucial, particularly when predicting GPP from
various predictors. However, despite their simplicity and effectiveness, ML
approaches encounter challenges, and the resulting flux estimates bear various
sources of uncertainty. The distribution and quantity EC sites play a pivotal
role in influencing the accuracy and variability of regional flux estimates
derived from machine learning methods [[Remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon
cycle A review of advances over 50 years|Papale et al 2015]].

In this study, I assess the advantages and contraints associated with the
utilization of 4 widely employed VIs for estimating GPP. The study specifically
focuses on VIs derived from the MODIS, which have long standing temporal records
and acceptable spatial resolution to study extended forest areas. The analysis
employs both traditional regression methods and ML techniques to evaluate the
performance of these indices in estimating GPP. This methodological approach
seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of the efficacy and limitations of the
selected indices in capturing the complexities of ecosystem processes,
particularly in the context of temperate broadleaf forests.
