# Introduction

The study and assessment of ecosystem dynamics have greatly benefited from the
development and advances of the remote sensing field [@running_continuous_2004;
@baldocchi_how_2020-1] coupled with the growing freely available remote sensing
data [@xiao_remote_2019]. Elements on the Earth surface exhibit distinctive
spectral signatures arising from their physical properties and interactions with
electromagnetic radiation [@montero_standardized_2023]. Environmental factors
(fires, floods, drought, etc) can affect these interactions modifying the
spectral signatures which can provide insights about surface process when
measured by remote sensing instruments [@montero_standardized_2023].

The launch in the 1970's of the  Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS),
later known as Landsat-1 [@donato_landsat_nodate], initiated a new era in the
remote sensing field of the terrestrial biosphere, with a special focus on
vegetation monitoring [@montero_standardized_2023]. With information available
about spectral bands, studies about their relations to biophysical
characteristics became an object of study to estimate biomass and photosynthetic
activity [@myneni_estimation_1997]

In fact, one application of remote sensing have been the development of
vegetation indices (VI) to study the characteristics of vegetation canopies and
functioning [@houborg_advances_2015]. VIs are a function of two or more spectral
bands, typically derived from satellite images [@zeng_optical_2022]. that can
contain information about the status of the vegetation, biochemical
characteristics, structural characteristics such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), among
others [@huete_overview_2002].

Early studies about spectral bands relations, lead to the development of the
NDVI, which showed how the NIR and Red ratio had advantages over other bands
ratios for monitoring vegetation biomass and structure given surface reflectance
measurements in the shortwave spectrum [@tucker1979red;
@richardson1977distinguishing]. The basis of NDVI rests in the fact that
chlorophyll absorption leads to a decrease in red reflectance with increasing
green vegetation relative to the NIR reflectance, that is minimally impacted by
chlrophyll absorption [@ramachandran_modis_2010].

The use of a relative indicator serves to reduce the effect of factors such as
canopy spatial structure and non-photosynthetic vegetation on relationships
between NDVI and biophysical variables such as biomass or absorbed
photosynthetically active radiation variances [@sellers_canopy_1987;
@ramachandran_modis_2010]. Nonetheless, NDVI is sensitive to soil background and
saturation at high biomass [@huete_overview_2002]. To overcome this problem, the
Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI) was designed to improve vegetation
characterizations such as canopy greenness without soil background sensitivity
and aerosol variations by combining the blue, red, and NIR bands
[@huete1988soil]. EVI is also less prone to saturate at high biomass instances
[@gao_opticalbiophysical_2000]

The ability to combine reflectance from multiple spectral bands, coupled with
advancements and  the development of new sensor technologies introducing
additional bands or different spectral characteristics, has created
opportunities to develop multiple VIs  and the total number of indices have
grown steadily [@zeng_optical_2022]. These equations can function as proxies for
various vegetation canopy properties or enhance existing estimations across
different ecosystems [@ramachandran_modis_2010].

According to the Awesome Spectral Indices open community catalogue (version
4.0.0), there are 127 spectral indices designed to monitor vegetation. The aim
behind the ongoing development of new VIs is to achieve a more accurate mapping
of ecosystem variables such as GPP. [@montero_standardized_2023]. These 
indices can be classified into 3 main categories: biophysical, biochemical and 
physiological properties [@zeng_optical_2022] **Describe the categories**

One important variable to understand ecosystems processes is GPP. At present,
VIs derived from satellites cannot directly estimate GPP
[@gensheimer_convolutional_2022] and instead, instruments like eddy covariance
have been the traditional method to estimate GPP more directly
[@baldocchi_how_2020-1].

GPP represents the total amount of carbon compunds produced by plant
photosynthesis in a given period of time [@ashton_managing_2012]. GPP plays a
crucial role in the carbon cycle since it quantifies the ability of vegetation
to fix carbon from the atmosphere using only solar energy and nutrients
[@xiao_remote_2019]. GPP is responsive to a range of factors, including abiotic
elements such as radiation, temperature, and precipitation
[@beer_terrestrial_2010], as well as biotic factors like vegetation type, leaf
chemical traits, and species composition [@musavi_stand_2017].

Some of the carbon taken in by GPP is release back to the atmosphere through
plant respiration (autotrophic respiration), and the difference between GPP and
plant respiration  is called Net Primary Productivity (NPP) [@lieth1975modeling;
@xiao_remote_2019]. GPP, along with Ecosystem Respiration (ER), which includes
both autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, together determines Net
Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) [@xiao_remote_2019]. NEE is fundamental to the
planetary carbon cycle as it represents the net accumulation or loss of carbon
by the ecosystem. Measurement of GPP and NEE are critical to understanding the
role of the biosphere in the carbon cycle as well as the status and trends of
vegetation productivity [@schimel_terrestrial_1995]

Eddy Covariance (EC) is a method used to measure the exchange of energy and
materials between ecosystems and the atmosphere within an area that can range
from a few hundred meters to a few kilometers [@pabon-moreno_potential_2022].
Specifically, EC methods can estimate GPP in-situ at temporal resolution of
seconds, by subtracting estimates of respiration from chamber measurements or
models from direct measurements of NEE [@reichstein_separation_2005]. However,
EC estimates are both, costly and limited in spatial coverage
[@baldocchi_how_2020-1]. Also, uncertainties from this method lies in the
typical increase in spatial and temporal variability in GPP over heteregeneous
landscapes such as forest boundaries [@reinmann_edge_2017]. The prevalent
practice of taking measurements primarily from intact forests introduces the
risk of potentially misleading estimations for the broader forest being
quantified, given the potential differences in dynamics between edge and
interior environments [@smith_piecing_2018].

Since direct GPP measurements from satellites are not presently available, one
of the primary objectives of remote sensing is to enhance the spatial coverage
of EC GPP estimates [@xiao_remote_2019]. In this context, EC values prove
invaluable as information for calibrating VIs values with GPP inferred from flux
towers [@ramachandran_modis_2010]. The utilization of EC measurements bridges
the gap in GPP assessment, providing a practical means to evaluate and refine
the reliability of remotely sensed data against ground-based observations
[@xiao_remote_2019].

Various methods exist for estimating GPP through satellite measurements.
Satellite-derived VIs serve as commonly employed proxies for GPP, whereas
quantifying GPP more directly often involves the use of Light Use Efficiency
(LUE) models,  and process-based models [@xiao_remote_2019]. These diverse
methodologies cater to different aspects of GPP estimation, with
satellite-derived VIs offering a convenient indirect assessment, while LUE
models, and process-based models provide more detailed and direct quantification
[@lin_improved_2021].

The concept of a more detailed and direct quantification of GPP achieved through
LUE and process-based models can be attributed to the incorporation of a
constant maximal light use efficiency, which is a plant functional type
dependent parameter which is down regulated by stress factors such as
temperature and vapor pressure deficit [@pabon-moreno_potential_2022]. This
approach is then integrated with APAR derived from remote sensing data to
estimate GPP in the case of LUE models  [@running_continuous_2004]. In contrast,
process-based models distinguish themselves by prioritizing a mechanistic
description of the photosynthetic biochemical processes at both leaf and canopy
scales, incorporating the comprehensive theoretical underpinnings of
photosynthesis [@ryu_integration_2011]. This methodology not only refines GPP
quantification but also offers a more in-depth understanding of the underlying
physiological processes governing vegetation productivity.

However, both Light Use Efficiency (LUE) models and process-based models demand
a multitude of inputs, some of which may not be readily available for all sites.
In such cases, a data-driven approach becomes particularly advantageous, and VIs
serve as effective proxies for GPP estimation. Notably, emerging VIs like the
Near-Infrared Reflectance Index (NIRv) demonstrate a capability to account for
68% of the monthly variability in GPP across 105 fluxnet sites
[@badgley_terrestrial_2019]. Additionally, indices like CCI, a pigment-based
index designed to capture carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios during seasonal
photosynthetic activity in evergreen leaves [@gamon_remotely_2016], have
demonstrated proficiency as estimators of GPP in certain forest types. These
indices offer valuable insights into the dynamics of vegetation productivity.

Despite the notable progress in VIs development and their user-friendly
applications there is a consensus that no single VI can be universally applied
to address every GPP estimation across species and time periods, even for a
single biome [@zeng_optical_2022]. VI measurement error poses additional
challenges to remote sensing applications, with diverse sources affecting
satellite-derived data, including atmospheric effects, retrieval errors, cloud
contamination, and sensor degradation [@van_leeuwen_multi-sensor_2006;
@fang_theoretical_2012]. Thus, a quantitative and rigorous understanding of the
specific context and characteristics of multiple sites is essential to
understand the potential and limits of VIs for GPP estimation over large extents
of space and time. [@zeng_optical_2022].

Together with the advancement of new VIs, there has been a upsurge in data
analysis methods, specifically Machine Learning (ML) approaches, has garnered
significance in recent years. The capability of ML methods to navigate
non-linear relationships proves crucial, particularly when predicting GPP from
various predictors [@meyer_importance_2019]. However, despite their simplicity
and effectiveness, ML approaches encounter challenges, and the resulting flux
estimates bear various sources of uncertainty. The distribution and quantity EC
sites play a pivotal role in influencing the accuracy and variability of
regional flux estimates derived from machine learning methods
[@papale_effect_2015].

The goal of this study is to assess the advantages and contraints associated
with the utilization of 4 widely employed VIs for estimating GPP. The study is
limited to temperate broadleaf forests of Eastern United States of America and
Canada as it required consistent multi-annual EC GPP measurements over multiple
sites to quantify uncertainty related to spatial location of calibration data.
The VIs are derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS), which have long standing temporal records and acceptable spatial
resolution to study extended forest areas. The analysis employs both traditional
regression methods and ML techniques to evaluate the performance of these
indices in estimating GPP. This methodological approach seeks to provide a
nuanced understanding of the efficacy and limitations of the selected indices in
capturing the complexities of ecosystem processes, particularly in the context
of temperate broadleaf forests.
